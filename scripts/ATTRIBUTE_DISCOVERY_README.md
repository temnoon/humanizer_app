# Gutenberg Attribute Discovery Scripts 📚

## 🎯 What This Does

These scripts discover and catalog **narrative attributes** from Project Gutenberg literature using Quantum Narrative Theory (QNT) analysis. The discovered attributes provide insights into literary patterns and can be used for:

- **Content Analysis** - Understanding narrative voice, cultural context, style, and meaning patterns
- **Literary Research** - Cataloging personas, namespaces, styles, and essences across classic literature  
- **Training Data** - Building datasets for machine learning models
- **Pattern Recognition** - Identifying recurring narrative elements in classic texts

## 🔍 What Gets Discovered

### 🎭 **Personas** - Narrative Voice & Perspective
Examples from the demo:
- `neutral observer` - Objective, third-person narrative voice
- `philosophical contemplator` - Deep, reflective perspective  
- `wise elder` - Experienced, instructive voice
- `curious child` - Innocent, questioning perspective

### 🌍 **Namespaces** - Cultural & Domain Context  
Examples from the demo:
- `contemporary realism` - Modern, realistic setting context
- `renaissance drama` - Shakespearean theatrical context
- `victorian society` - 19th century British cultural context
- `maritime adventure` - Seafaring, nautical domain

### ✍️ **Styles** - Linguistic & Rhetorical Approach
Examples from the demo:
- `descriptive prose` - Rich, detailed narrative style
- `elevated poetic` - Formal, literary language
- `conversational` - Informal, accessible style  
- `dramatic dialogue` - Theater-influenced speech patterns

### 💎 **Essences** - Core Meaning & Invariant Elements
Examples from the demo:
- `A narrative describing a situation or event` - Straightforward descriptive content
- `Existential questioning about life and death` - Deep philosophical exploration
- `Social commentary on class and marriage` - Cultural critique and observation
- `Adventure and discovery narrative` - Journey and exploration themes

## 🎯 **Use Cases**

### 1. **Literary Analysis**
```bash
# Discover what narrative voices are used in classic literature
humanizer analyze "Famous quote or passage" --format summary

# Compare attributes across different authors/periods
./final_attribute_demo.sh
```

### 2. **Content Classification**
Use discovered attributes to:
- Train machine learning models to classify text by style
- Build content recommendation systems
- Create writing style analysis tools
- Develop narrative voice detection systems

### 3. **Research Applications**
- **Digital Humanities**: Catalog narrative patterns across literature
- **Stylometry**: Quantify writing style differences between authors
- **Comparative Literature**: Analyze cultural and temporal narrative shifts
- **AI Training**: Create labeled datasets for narrative understanding models

### 4. **Writing Tools**
The insights can inform:
- Style guides for different narrative approaches
- Writing assistance tools that suggest voice/tone adjustments
- Content generation systems that match specific narrative patterns
- Editorial tools that identify inconsistent narrative elements

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### QNT Analysis Process
1. **Text Input** → Famous literature excerpt
2. **QNT Processing** → 4-component analysis (Persona, Namespace, Style, Essence)
3. **Attribute Extraction** → Structured data about narrative elements
4. **Confidence Scoring** → Quality metrics for each discovered attribute
5. **Cataloging** → Organized lists of unique narrative patterns

### Data Structure
Each discovered attribute includes:
```
{
  "name": "neutral observer",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "type": "persona",
  "characteristics": ["objective", "descriptive"],
  "source_text": "Original literature excerpt...",
  "cultural_context": "contemporary realism"
}
```

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Demo Run (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/tem/humanizer-lighthouse/scripts
./final_attribute_demo.sh

# View results
cat final_demo_*/discovered_personas.txt
cat final_demo_*/analysis_01.txt
```

### Advanced Discovery
```bash
# For comprehensive analysis of many books
./attribute_discovery_v2.sh

# Results in: attribute_analysis_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

## 📈 **Expected Output Quality**

- **High Confidence Attributes**: 0.7+ confidence scores
- **Diverse Coverage**: Multiple personas, namespaces, styles per run
- **Literary Accuracy**: Attributes that match known literary analysis
- **Usable Insights**: Actionable data for research and development

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

### Transformation vs. Analysis
- **QNT Analysis** discovers attributes FROM existing text
- **Transformations** use predefined attributes TO change text
- Discovered attributes are for understanding, not direct transformation

### Current Limitations
- QNT analysis sometimes returns generic attributes ("neutral observer")
- Better results with longer, more distinctive text passages  
- Mock data in some Gutenberg endpoints affects real-book analysis

### Recommended Usage
1. **Start with demo** to understand the process
2. **Use results for research** rather than direct transformation
3. **Combine with manual analysis** for best literary insights
4. **Scale up gradually** to larger book collections
