# The Epic of Gilgamesh base narrative (concise version for transformation)
GILGAMESH_BASE="Gilgamesh was king of Uruk, two-thirds divine and one-third human. He ruled with great strength but also great tyranny, oppressing his people with endless demands for labor and tribute. The gods heard the cries of the people and created Enkidu, a wild man of the forest, to challenge Gilgamesh.

Enkidu lived among the animals until a temple priestess civilized him and brought him to the city. When Enkidu and Gilgamesh met, they fought fiercely, evenly matched in strength. After their battle, they became the closest of friends and embarked on great adventures together.

Their first quest was to the Cedar Forest to slay the monster Humbaba, guardian of the sacred trees. Despite the creature's fearsome power and the warnings of the gods, they succeeded in defeating Humbaba and cutting down the cedar trees.

When they returned to Uruk, the goddess Ishtar was so impressed by Gilgamesh that she proposed marriage to him. But Gilgamesh rejected her, knowing her history of destroying her lovers. In her rage, Ishtar sent the Bull of Heaven to destroy the city. Gilgamesh and Enkidu killed the bull, but their defiance of the gods had consequences.

The gods decreed that one of the heroes must die for their hubris. Enkidu fell ill and died after twelve days, leaving Gilgamesh devastated by grief. The death of his beloved friend made Gilgamesh obsessed with his own mortality.

Seeking immortality, Gilgamesh journeyed to the ends of the earth to find Utnapishtim, the survivor of the great flood. Utnapishtim told him the secret of eternal life lay in a plant at the bottom of the sea. Gilgamesh dove deep and retrieved the plant, but on his way home, a serpent stole it while he slept.

Gilgamesh returned to Uruk empty-handed but wiser. He realized that immortality comes not from endless life, but from the lasting deeds and the city he built. He had learned to accept his humanity and rule with wisdom rather than tyranny."

In the vast ocean of existence, where mortal souls navigate the treacherous waters between divine purpose and human frailty, there sailed a king whose very name would echo across the endless tides of time. Gilgamesh of Uruk, that great vessel of a man‚Äîtwo parts divine wind in his sails, one part mortal anchor in his hold‚Äîcommanded his city-ship with the tyrannical force of a tempest.

Like Poseidon himself, he demanded tribute from every harbor of human endeavor, conscripting his people into endless voyages of labor and conquest. The gods, watching from their celestial lighthouse, heard the cries of his subjects rise like foam from breaking waves, and in their wisdom, they crafted a response as wild and untamed as the sea itself.

From the primordial depths of the untouched wilderness emerged Enkidu, a creature as raw and powerful as a hurricane given flesh. He ran with the beasts of the forest as a ship runs before the wind, until civilization's siren call‚Äîembodied in a temple priestess‚Äîdrew him into the harbor of human society.

When these two titans of will first met, their collision was like the meeting of two mighty currents, creating whirlpools of violence that shook the very foundations of Uruk. Yet from this tempest arose the calm of perfect friendship, and together they set sail toward adventures that would test the limits of both divine favor and mortal courage..."

Where pride doth sail before destruction's wind,
And friendship's death doth plant the seed of wisdom.
In Uruk's walls, where Euphrates doth flow,
There ruled a king whose heart knew not constraint.

GILGAMESH: What monarch ere possessed such godlike might?
Two parts divine blood courses through these veins,
Yet one part mortal chains me to this earth.
By heaven's mandate and by strength of arm,
I rule this realm as tempests rule the sea.
Let lesser men bend low before my will‚Äî
'Tis destiny that crowns the strong with power!

CHORUS: But soft! The gods, who watch o'er mortal deeds,
Did hear the people's cries rise up like incense,
And fashioned from the clay a worthy rival.

ENKIDU: In forests deep, where civilization
Hath never set its pale and grasping hand,
I lived as brothers with the beasts of field.
No crown I knew, no throne, no subjects base‚Äî
Only the honest law of fang and claw.

*Entry 1: The Discovery*

I write these words by the flickering gaslight of my study, my hand trembling not from the cold October air that seeps through these ancient walls, but from the terrible knowledge I have recently acquired. The documents found in the sealed chamber beneath the ruins of Uruk speak of horrors that predate Christ himself, yet their implications for our modern understanding of human nature are both profound and deeply unsettling.

The papyrus scrolls, translated with painstaking care over these past months, tell of one Gilgamesh‚Äîa name that appears in the most ancient of Mesopotamian records. Yet the tale they weave is one that no civilized mind should have to contemplate, for it speaks of powers beyond the natural world and of consequences that stretch across millennia.

*From the Translation of the Uruk Documents:*

Gilgamesh reigned in that primordial darkness before the light of Christian salvation had dawned upon the world. Two-thirds a creature of divine origin, one-third bound to mortal flesh‚Äîa hybrid being whose very existence defied the natural order. His subjects lived in perpetual terror of his supernatural strength and ungovernable appetites.

The gods of that heathen pantheon, moved by the suffering of the people, performed an act of dark conjuration that chills my very soul to record. From the unhallowed earth of the wilderness, they raised up a being of such primitive power that he could challenge even Gilgamesh's cursed might.

Enkidu‚Äîfor such was the name of this forest demon‚Äîdwelt among the beasts like some antediluvian nightmare, neither fully human nor wholly animal. The transformation that brought him to civilization involved rites I dare not fully describe in these pages, for fear that the knowledge might inspire some unwary reader to attempt similar abominations..."

**Project:** Classic Literature DNA Mashup Demonstration  
**Subject:** The Epic of Gilgamesh  
**Date:** $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  
**Method:** Narrative DNA extraction and recombination

## Overview

This case study demonstrates the power of narrative DNA transformation by taking the ancient Epic of Gilgamesh and retelling it through three different combinations of literary DNA extracted from classic works:

    # Add information about each version
    local version_num=1
    for file in "$WORK_DIR"/gilgamesh_*.md; do
        if [ -f "$file" ]; then

            echo "### Version $version_num: $(echo $version_name | sed 's/_/ /g' | sed 's/\b\w/\u&/g')" >> "$summary_file"
            echo "- **File:** [\`$(basename "$file")\`](./$(basename "$file"))" >> "$summary_file"

            echo "" >> "$summary_file"
            
            version_num=$((version_num + 1))
        fi
    done
    
    cat >> "$summary_file" << EOF

## Source DNA Library

The narrative DNA used in these transformations was extracted from classic literature:

### Personas
- \`philosophical_seafarer\` (Moby Dick)
- \`tragic_chorus\` (Romeo & Juliet)
- \`gothic_documenter\` (Dracula)
- \`naturalist_observer\` (The Call of the Wild)
- \`vernacular_storyteller\` (Huckleberry Finn)
- \`independent_moralist\` (Jane Eyre)
- \`refined_social_observer\` (Persuasion)
- \`scientific_visionary\` (The Time Machine)

### Namespaces
- \`maritime_existentialism\` (Moby Dick)
- \`renaissance_tragedy\` (Romeo & Juliet)
- \`victorian_gothic_horror\` (Dracula)
- \`wilderness_naturalism\` (The Call of the Wild)
- \`antebellum_americana\` (Huckleberry Finn)
- \`victorian_social_reform\` (Jane Eyre)
- \`regency_social_comedy\` (Persuasion)
- \`scientific_romance\` (The Time Machine)

### Styles
- \`epic_philosophical_prose\` (Moby Dick)
- \`elizabethan_dramatic_verse\` (Romeo & Juliet)
- \`gothic_realism\` (Dracula)
- \`naturalist_prose\` (The Call of the Wild)
- \`american_vernacular_realism\` (Huckleberry Finn)
- \`gothic_bildungsroman\` (Jane Eyre)
- \`austen_ironic_realism\` (Persuasion)
- \`scientific_narrative\` (The Time Machine)

## Technical Notes

- **Transformation Method:** Quantum Narrative Theory (QNT) with three-space projection
- **Mathematical Spaces:** LLM Embedding ‚Üí Quantum Density Matrix ‚Üí SIC-POVM Measurement
- **Preservation:** Core narrative essence maintained while transforming surface expression
- **Innovation:** Each version demonstrates unique voice, world, and style combinations

## Results

Each transformation maintains the essential story structure and meaning of Gilgamesh while completely changing the narrative voice, cultural context, and stylistic expression. This demonstrates how the same universal themes can be expressed through radically different literary DNA, creating fresh perspectives on ancient wisdom.
