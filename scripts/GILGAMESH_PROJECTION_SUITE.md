# 🏺 The Epic of Gilgamesh - Narrative DNA Projection Suite

## Overview

This interactive test suite demonstrates the complete **Narrative DNA Projection** pipeline using the Epic of Gilgamesh as source material. It showcases how narrative essence can be preserved while transforming surface manifestations across different personas, namespaces, and stylistic patterns.

## 🎯 Theoretical Foundation

The suite implements the formal **POVM (Positive Operator-Valued Measure)** framework for narrative transformation:

```
Original Narrative (ρ) → DNA Extraction → Projection Operators → Transformed Narrative (ρ')
```

Where essence invariants are preserved: `Tr(ρ · E_essence) = Tr(ρ' · E_essence)`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
cd /Users/tem/humanizer-lighthouse/scripts
./run_gilgamesh_suite.sh
```

### Automated Demo
```bash
./run_gilgamesh_suite.sh demo
```

### Prerequisites Check Only
```bash
./run_gilgamesh_suite.sh check
```

## 🎭 Available Projections

### Personas (Voice/Perspective)
- **tragic_chorus** - Omniscient dramatic voice with prophetic awareness
- **cyberpunk_hacker** - Tech-savvy urban narrator with cynical edge
- **victorian_narrator** - Formal, elaborate Victorian literary voice

### Namespaces (Cultural Context)
- **ancient_mesopotamia** - Original epic context with gods and ancient cities
- **cyberpunk_dystopia** - Futuristic urban landscape with digital themes
- **regency_england** - Jane Austen-era social context and settings

### Styles (Linguistic Patterns)
- **epic_verse** - Elevated diction with repetition and epithets
- **noir_prose** - Short sentences, urban imagery, cynical tone
- **stream_of_consciousness** - Fragmented, associative internal monologue

## 📚 Source Material

The suite uses six key passages from the Epic of Gilgamesh:

1. **Opening** - Introduction of Gilgamesh as divine king
2. **Friendship** - Meeting and bonding of Gilgamesh and Enkidu
3. **Cedar Forest** - Journey to face Humbaba
4. **Death of Enkidu** - Gilgamesh's grief and mortality awareness
5. **Quest for Immortality** - Search for eternal life
6. **Wisdom** - Final understanding of human mortality

## 🔮 Example Projections

### Original Passage (Friendship)
> "When Gilgamesh and Enkidu first met, they fought like wild bulls, shaking the very foundations of Uruk with their battle. But when their strength proved equal, they embraced as brothers, and their friendship became legendary throughout the land."

### Tragic Chorus + Ancient Mesopotamia + Epic Verse
> "We witness Gilgamesh and Enkidu in their first meeting, and know that brotherhood must follow their battle. Behold how these heroes fought like wild bulls, yet understands not the price of their legendary friendship woven by the gods into the very fabric of this tale."

### Cyberpunk Hacker + Cyberpunk Dystopia + Noir Prose
> "The data streams showed Gilgamesh and Enkidu's first connection cascading through the network. They jacked into the system and battled. Their trusted connection in hostile network became legendary. In Neo-Tokyo, Gilgamesh walked among the familiar streets."

### Victorian Narrator + Regency England + Stream of Consciousness
> "It was with considerable force that Gilgamesh and Enkidu first encountered one another and battled. The reader will perhaps forgive my observation regarding their subsequent brotherhood. Such was the nature of their intimate acquaintance of long standing, whose legendary quality proved most remarkable."

## 📊 Metrics and Analysis

### Essence Preservation Score
Measures how well core semantic invariants are maintained:
- **Characters**: Gilgamesh, Enkidu preserved across projections
- **Events**: Battle → brotherhood sequence maintained
- **Themes**: Friendship, strength, legendary status retained

### Projection Confidence
Combination of essence preservation and transformation completeness:
```
Confidence = min(essence_preservation × projection_strength, 1.0)
```

### Transformation Log
Detailed record of each projection step:
1. Essence extraction (events, characters, themes)
2. Persona transformation (voice patterns applied)
3. Namespace transformation (cultural mappings)
4. Style transformation (linguistic patterns)
5. Essence validation (preservation scoring)

## 🧬 Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Narrative Projection Engine** (`narrative_projection_engine.py`)
   - Essence extraction and preservation
   - Multi-layered transformation pipeline
   - POVM-inspired projection operators

2. **Interactive Agent Frontend** (`gilgamesh_projection_suite.py`)
   - Command-line interface with rich interactions
   - Session history and comparison tools
   - Guided demonstrations and analysis

3. **Discovery Integration**
   - Uses attributes discovered from Project Gutenberg
   - Leverages canonical text anchoring system
   - Applies learned prosody, syntax, and discourse patterns

### Data Flow
```
Gilgamesh Passage → Essence Extraction → 
Persona Voice Patterns → Namespace Cultural Mappings → 
Style Linguistic Transforms → Projected Narrative
```

### Projection Templates
Structured transformation rules for each DNA component:

```python
'tragic_chorus': {
    'voice_patterns': [
        'We witness {event}, and know that {consequence} must follow',
        'Behold how {character} {action}, yet understands not the price'
    ],
    'syntax_transforms': {
        'first_person': 'collective_we',
        'perspective': 'omniscient_dramatic'
    }
}
```

## 🎯 Demonstration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Voice Evolution
Transform the same passage through different personas while keeping namespace and style constant. Observe how voice/perspective changes while essence remains.

### Scenario 2: Cultural Translation
Project across namespaces (Mesopotamia → Cyberpunk → Victorian) while maintaining persona and style. See how cultural context translates universal themes.

### Scenario 3: Stylistic Variation
Apply different linguistic patterns to the same content. Notice how rhythm, syntax, and discourse markers change expression while preserving meaning.

### Scenario 4: Complete Transformation
Full projection across all three dimensions simultaneously. Demonstrates maximum transformation with essence preservation.
