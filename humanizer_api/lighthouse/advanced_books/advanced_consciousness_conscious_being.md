Beings are time travelers. In fact, they move only in time, in an absolute way. Movement in space is relative.

Light moves only in space, not in time.

Human Beings are beings. We absorb and emit light (as electromagnetic energy).

We move light through time, and light moves us through space.

So, let’s see.

If I were to put it all together, I would want to write about, as always, how the world works.

Be specific. For myself, I want to understand, between my senses and memory what will happen in the future based on what I am seeing now, and what I remember from the past. Who I am is what I know about my path from my memory horizon, and I know about now through my senses. It is my actions that move me into the future. The principle action is time itself, which is that possibility of change, which is Now.

The objectiveness of the outside world is an assumption which is not founded in observation, because all observations are necessarily subjective.

A human being is a biological being which is propelled through a timeline of sensations, actions, and reactions, all of which plays out between corporeal substance from our bodies out into every corner of our imagination.

For us to be asking questions, finding answers and writing them down, it means that we live in a world of language and we mentally spend most of our waking hours and even many movements of our minds into words, then allowing words to evoke movements in our mind which strike us with every emotion we are capable of.

While the benefits of language, and specifically the written languages which have conquered the entire species, are diverse and fundamental to our way of life, it is crucial that we step back and for a moment question what we may have lost by growing so dependent on the modes of thinking demanded by written language consciousness.

What is required for a calculus of consciousness? A model of a Being in a Subjective Field of Being.

Definitions—
Being Energy = Being as a Verb = Be

The amount of Energy embodied in the fundamental cycle of each Being.

Being Mass = Being as a Noun = Bm

The Returned Energy that is not dissipated in the fundamental cycle of each being.

The rate of time is relative to the local time field = gravity field.
The fact of time (consciousness) is an attribute of Being.

It's Time to start over.

Suppose you've been taught to understand the workings of people society and overall culture in terms of Belief Systems. You learn a few ideas about each, and somewhere you decide what you believe, who you think you are and you settle down to talk to people who think like you about people you think don't think like you, among other things.

I'm suggesting to put all that aside. What do you believe about belief? What do you believe anything here, or at least what will not ask you or anyone to believe what you are not saying these words to be believed, but to give you a vocabulary about consciousness and what it evokes, what it means to you... and I hope to inspire you a little to step back from thinking anything gained by believing words without understanding fully what the words mean, without having worked the details out yourself.

The structure of Now is the structure of the Universe.

The structure of the Universe is the structure of Now.

Now is all of Time. The Universe is all of Space.

Now defines an ontological frame of reference - conscious existence, and an act of Time crossed with an experience of the Universe through senses, and processed through mind to action.

Space is the medium of action, the canvas of entangled beings of uncountable levels large and small.

Now is an act, and the action of Now requires a Being. Its action is to complete a cycle of being. The cycle has a duration which defines the temporary limit of consciousness. And thus what is the briefest interval that a being can call a moment.

Walter Russell and the Vibrational Physics folks are very inspiring

Stillness Knowing O "Mind of God"

Resonance Sensing OK O spirit/light

Cause and Effect are a part of matching [preserving the Reimann hypothesis?]

The connection between these two states is Being which I would say Consciousness - which is to say time. Being-Consciousness-Time - and everything we must "do" are different names for the same ultimate thing.

The key distinction that the vibrational physics vocabulary and semantics do that is saying to me... [text cuts off] My intuition of existence is enough to prove to me that my subjectivism does serve as part of a universe where my perspective is essential to the whole universe. I am alone to witness the miracle for God. As God, at the Bodhisattva which I am, Birthing A New Moment.

Or will you only say
You like me this way

It's what I'm seeing

A one goal Dance

But I could not ask
I'll look for a chance

At your service
By your side

What Am I

Are you expected to be
distracted to death,
Till Death we Distract

Marriage to Distraction

People are the text consciousness
yet in their imagination is created
a physicality which people's names
are tied to.

Men can we stop to
avoid self-knowledge
in favor of what others
would think about what
they are doing.

PLEASE
Don't give me
Impossible Love - 3x

Please don't leave me in

Please, can we dance?
Will you hold out your hand?
Will you be in my band?

Please don't by any

Summer Journal

My trip starts today, in a sense. A month from my birthday, a new journal bought by my mother as it happens. One more thing to be grateful for. I'll get back to long island before I leave for Tennessee ad points south - but my journey has begun, so huge I am documenting. Creating the narrative. A shadow narrative at best, of the experience.

Yeah wrote the date yesterday but then didn't write anything!

Today I've driven with a few people to Hartford Tennessee to see some friends playing for a charity event. They have a Hummus & Tabouli platter and Sushi for the fundraising special. Exactly my food choice. Then those cookies with coffee.

There's a dog named Grandpa. Color B and shape like a Saint Bernard but short hair, mixed in with the hounds. Quietly moves through the crowd, looking for a scratch behind the soft ears (and any other thing).

Sitting on an outdoor deck watching the band, night next to a river. Looking at a large Ulmus tree, among many others, slowly closing the bridge overgrowing the side shift it.

What is consciousness?
How can the issues of consciousness be addressed to help global ecological issues?

What is the experience & supernatural events?
What is transcendental phenomenology?

What is the structure of intersubjectivity?
What is the nature of the observer?

What is the nature of language?

What is the nature of personal experience?

What is the model of the world?

How does Conscious process the meaning of sentences and other events?

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, experience, time

Phenomenology is not an unusual topic for our minds to understand because it is simply a precise name for an activity we are doing literally all the time, yet it is so familiar that it is rare that we contemplate the specific components of our experience of the flow of life. Phenomenology is the study of how consciousness encounters phenomena of the senses. To propose a narrative as "a phenomenology" is to propose writing a description, but usually memorable realizations, structures, and milestones of a personal exploration of the subject through anecdotal adventures. That is what I am laying down for you, a set of marks which to me would describe something like what it may have had in mind.

Is There a Flaw in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of definitions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so I will need to explain and explore what I think of as "consciousness", as well as the most intuitive meaning of the word when I see it used in texts and commentary.

Conscious is first and foremost personal; you faithful reader are likely being that at this moment in life, or if you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you. It's your text-to-speech process if it's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words and translates them into personal memories is only one part of consciousness. Each sense is an end of consciousness, each neuron can evoke a peak-like node of awareness.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond an idea, consciousness is an existential strand in a physically interactive manifold.

7 October 2021

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it, so here I am, on a plane for the first time in... 13+ years... with Molly flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Corrin, and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A Consciousness First Ontology".

Ontology is the study of Being, Being is the action of existence. It also can refer to a being, which is the subject of experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology, then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own (life in particular).

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of the characteristics of existence.

The word is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness itself through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond that, consciousness is an existential stand in a physically interactive manifold.

Is There a Plan in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of notions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so the need to explain and explore what I think the most intricate as well of the word about meaning used in texts and commentaries, see...

Consciousness is first and foremost personal. You, faithful reader, are the being that at this moment is conscious. If you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you, that is your text-speech nexus. It's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time-horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words we translate, them into personal memories and build the past of consciousness. Each sense is a kind of consciousness, each emotion can evoke a particular mode of consciousness.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people's experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions, but the approach used is used here is focused on the writer of this text and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this relative to how to specify exactly what possible the Writing Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, time, being, experience

While the duration and complexity of various Beings at all ranges of levels vary infinitely, the most fundamental attributes are the same across all known, possible, and unknown beings.

A being in the Universe is one which can interact with that universe through resonant frequencies in some medium which is maintained over the Being's fundamental cycle of Time Consciousness.

Everything experienced is driven by the Being's actions, which only individual Beings have access to.

That action defines a cycle of 3 states which cancel to Nothing each full cycle of Being.

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

I think I’m on to something.

Written language consciousness derived systems work top-down. There’s control centrally to agents in the wider field.

In nature systems tend to be bottom up. The control is mediated at the peripheries. Communicative networks delay this into activity similar to central control.

Written language systems can coop most conscious minds trapped in written language belief syndrome – but some can see their way through to a single alternative only visible by stepping out of the written language assumptions.

In Phenomenology, we must first put aside all postulates and all presuppositions and expectations about the experience we are having.

Phenomena experienced in a deliberately phenomenological, focussed, is said to be bracketed.

The name of the bracketed state, as chosen by Husserl, is the "Epoché", a Greek word which means to abstain, as n abstain from any judgement. Our conscious state at all times is constrained by the limits of what our senses can show us of the world, crossed with the limits on our mind and what it can conceive as a world. The limits are always there, the phenomenological Epoché is a deliberate conscious state which strives for self-attention at overcoming its own limits of cognition; to examine the limits of what our senses crossed with our conceptions can know.

present, and anything in excess of this would be obstructive & redundant—like red ink in a rose. Otherwise, it is simply necessary to see that our usual "I" is a false and impotent image. But just as this phantom cannot actually will or do anything, it cannot get rid of itself. No tensing of muscles or, for that matter, deliberate relaxing of muscles, no repetitions of formulae, no self-suggestion, no exercises of imagination, no psychophysical regimens of any kind will do anything but add strength to the phantom. For every littlest movement to change, or to try not to change, the way you actually feel now will be just one more of those futile muscular tensions (like trying to lift an airliner off the ground by straining at your seat-belt) which give semblance to the reality of the separated ego. You, considered as that ego, cannot get polar vision or cosmic consciousness. It might arise all of itself, as if by divine grace, but there is nothing, just nothing, you can do or not do to bring it about. Yogis and Zen followers sometimes come to this point after long and heroic efforts.

At this point there is nothing to do except what is happening of itself. All that remains is the simple awareness of what is going on—trees outside, street sounds, clock ticking, sunlight on carpet, breathing, body feelings, talking to yourself in your head. Usual cosmic jazz. That's what there is, and every bit of it, including memories and recollections, is happening now. It comes out of nothing as sounds come out of silence, for it should be obvious that the universe has always started from now and left traces behind, like a pen as it writes, though the written record, the seeming past, is still and only now.

Can we be realistic for a change?

You must understand the world around you calibrated against your own Quiescence, your stillness. If you instead calibrate against other people's words, you will never be lead to your own stillness, and you will be ill-prepared for the ultimate calibration.

The Being never moves nor lives. What moves is time is the flickering image of the Being through the Being, with the energy moving through centers of Gravity.

Energy moves in space, material, in time.

Quiescence is a stillness. Everybody has a stillness a quiescence. It is the personal ground which defines at all times where you are. It is not that Quiescence is layers upon layers of vibrations, throbs, referents and refermals,

Upon the ground of stillness, our senses show us a world through a body. Our consciousness puts those events together into a model of the world.

There are two minds which must both be acknowledged when understanding the means of the things we see: The narrative mind and the whole mind.

The narrative mind is concerned with time, past and future, the whole and the Attention and Concentration mind is about symmetry, beauty, confession. Recognition of similarities, two sides of the same coin. To value one over the other can lead to trouble.

It's not that all narratives regarding science, religion, or any systematic model of a physical world is wrong. It is that without the equivalent of the Heart Sutra Science, they cannot be right.

Who are you?
People ask me that, so I have a story I can tell them a few stories really.

But when I ask myself am I asking to be told a story? No, I know those stories. And I know that none of them are true.

So who am I?
And when I ask you and you tell me your story, one of your stories - Do I know you? Do I know a story you told me...

There are many parts to each story, because I have an expectation of what people are wondering about when they ask me who I am.

The paradox of wanting to be helpful and the impossibility of really helping. I can make available words that to me seemed helpful, as I was saying them. As I was writing them. As I was thinking them.

It's hard not to internalize the negative narratives of others. It is even harder to not internalize the positive narratives of others.

Each of us has a feeling of selfness. We also have a feeling of selfness, neither of these perceptions contain our actual self. The feeling is an energetic state of our being at a given space & time. The narrative is a resulting set of actions (physical or mental formation) of the energetic state imagined into an imagined, recraftable form.

But each moment is really on its own. Our relation to Being (the verb) is not the physicality that can be observed but the process of energetic observation. To me, it's a variable, another feeling between Being and an idea of a being at best, distractingly.

The Absolute of Being is You. Every moment You are Being in a two-Fold relation with each Moment.

You = {What you think of the world / What you think of yourself}

You which is, who you think you are in the moment, is how the world is understood by written language consciousness.

For most people, as we relate to other people, we make a model of who we think they are and update it with each subsequent conversation.

Implicitly, in the experience of each moment, we are also conscious of who I am in relation to the other person engaged in discourse. In this way conversation creates identity sentence by sentence.

True meaning, ontological meaning, exists in what you call the sentence, and in the reading of any sentence or token.

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, time, experience, self

This is a Phenomenological perspective on Consciousness.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world (whether a dream or somehow actual), and understanding the world with a personal model built up over days, then weeks, then months, then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are in space and see how what we call consciousness is never quite what we are thinking about, but in fact it is time *itself*, seeing through our eyes. What "we" often consider ourself is some person we know in the field of persons and judge those events from a new time or new context, and if we identify with that idea of that person who we think we are, then we cannot see the clear consciousness of who we are now, in this moment.

That is why we invoke the Brackets of the Phenomenological Epoché.

We've scratched as much as we could.

We're recently thought about less than we ever have in the history of our species, and therefore have been more caught up in it than ever before. We are also in the position for the first time in history to overcome the fundamental problem and turn this earth into a paradise of love, life and freedom for all. If we don't, we will evaporate into a dusty cosmic snowflake of death within fifty years. Maybe within twenty.

I'm for paradise.

Here's [scratched out] the problem what it does to us, how we can get rid of it forever, and life without it.

I must remember, at all times, that I am one of many, and many of one.

I am the unity of my experiences, all the experience of my unity.

I am the diversity of my memory, all the memory of my diversity.

Objects affect other objects. 

These effects can only be noticed by Dasein.

They are also produced by Dasein.

Signs in The phenomena, 
recall memory into experience 
in the moment.

Signs, within the signs, 
in the phenomena, recall 
signs to experience.

This is what makes 
possible the loops.

Reflective consciousness 
is a sign, regarding a sign.

Of course the real 
consciousness, the soul,
which is not a soul is 
prior to the sign, and will 
far out last the sign. It is 
time itself - change, difference - 
and it makes experience possible, as 
well as memory, not to mention light 
and gravity.

writing connections are more 
difficult to connect with, but 
are nonetheless real.

I lost the words this 
time because I had to pause 
to catch my mental breath,

*Quality: 0.70 | Complexity: 2/5 | Tone: neutral | Words: 113*

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, being, experience, time

Now is always subjectively conscious in the mind of the Being in a Field of Being.

What we experience happening in the Field of Being guides us to know who we are, who we have been, and who we should be.

Who we are now is the lens through which we see it all. We remember our past, we imagine the future now. It is only Now that we can act, it is in Now that we can think or think we think. We must recognize this.

All Beings execute a time operation on their volume of space, which is experienced by the Being as Consciousness experiencing a change of state of being.

*Quality: 0.70 | Complexity: 2/5 | Tone: neutral | Words: 224*

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, experience, time

To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what evidence I can sense and what details then specific details reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about what's been, what's happened, about how models work. It and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books even if I learned things by good use, I would not truly learn down to the nitty-gritty how the world works, only by seeing the actions of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my interaction and my conscious concept at the current moment.

Consciousness is a name for My mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state I am seeing through to encounter the world, now. Consciousness only happens "Now" and in this way, Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experient as the subject of consciousness, Consciousness is the first person experience.

The diagram appears to represent a structured cyclical model—perhaps of time, perception, or consciousness—radiating outward from a central origin point. Twelve segments labeled I through XII resemble a clock or calendar system, with repeated “x” markings and alternating shaded patterns that may denote shifts in states or layers of experience. Heavy black curves arc across the structure, suggesting waveforms, thresholds, or transitions across the diagram’s sectors.

This visual could be seen as a phenomenological tool—an abstracted map of subjective time or consciousness, corresponding thematically to the text from the previous image.

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, being, time

we never fear the truth.

Human consciousness is moving in time like any other particle, with some interesting special qualities. It can use information gathered earlier in time to change its own state in the present, and its direction into the future. It also loses track of time at more or less regular intervals. People need to sleep and dream.

During our waking hours, our minds are ticking away some measure of time. Without timekeeping devices, we cannot be sure of exactly how much time has passed over a given interval, but we would notice that time had passed. While we are unconscious, we lose our sense of time totally. I know that I certainly can't tell the difference between sleeping for a half hour and sleeping for twenty-four hours. As far as our waking consciousness knows, we stop in time while we sleep.

Then, there are dreams. Dreams certainly exist, and take time, but it is very hard to relate time in a dream to time in real life. There is nothing to use as a standard which is constant to both worlds. They seem to be some sort of opposites of each other. Well, that is how I see it. If we assume we move forward in time while awake, (which seems somewhat arbitrary) then while we dream, we are moving backwards in time. This seems a satisfactory conclusion, being that dreams generally consist of past memories jumbled into a new arrangement. So even in human consciousness, time is conserved. Herein lies our immortality.

Being born is like turning on a lightbulb. Time is being given off by every point of mass. The light from the bulb stays at a constant time, propagating in all directions. A baby who is born rides a similar wave. He (she) is a continuous function of time. At any time after birth, that baby must be somewhere, and can only be at one place.

We take something for granted in our general outlook on the universe. It doesn't affect scientific findings very much, because it doesn't change the ideal cases and fundamental truths that science pursues. However, when talking about the specific case of a single human being, it matters a great deal. To explain I return to the lightbulb analogy. Eventually, one of those photons that's riding on its isochrone hits an atom, and is absorbed. Let's say it moves along with this atom for a little while, then is reemitted, absorbed by a different atom a distance away, reemitted, and so on. Now, nothing is wrong with that photon. It's just as happy being absorbed and reemitted as it was on that isochrone, but because it spent even the smallest amount of time being absorbed and moving in time, it can never again reach that same isochrone again. It will always be at least a little behind it.

What will the other photons think? Well, their buddy was absorbed. Every photon gets absorbed sooner or later, too bad it happened so soon. They mourn for him, and look at the hole in their shell, the shadow of the atom that absorbed him, and think about the inevitable day when they too will be absorbed.

I believe that the situation is exactly analogous to death as we see it in our reality. We may have been born at different times, but we are moving on the same isochronal surface. We are all continuous functions with respect to this particular wave of events that is steadily moving into the future. What would happen if someone were to stop moving for a moment? Well, in the world he was in, he would die. His body would stop working and his friends would be really depressed; However, what is stopping him from moving again in time? What if he was hit by a truck crossing the street? You might say that if it happened that way, that's it—it must always happen that way, but why? Why must there be only one wave of reality, which only passes once? The earth is a huge mass, so it should have a tremendous number of realities waiting to push out through space-time. Remember the point of this paper is the Conservation of Time principle. Take the point about moving backwards in time in dreams literally. If the person who was hit by the truck just takes a reality behind the reality where he is hit by the truck, and looks both ways before he crosses the street, he'll be fine. He'll never know that he was killed, and he'll still be continuous in what is now his reality. The rest of the world will be there, just about as they are in the reality ahead of him, where he died, but which he can never catch up to, because they are both traveling at the speed of time.

So, in conclusion, the universe seems like a pretty nice place to me. Everyone is immortal in their own realities, all the laws of science work out to be part of one Conservation of Time principle, and if I get really bored I can watch shampoo bubbles in the shower.

Seriously, this was an overview of Conservation of Time. I've left out quite a lot of the scientific verifications, and many scientific implications, such as thermodynamics and antimatter. I have included the main philosophical points, as it stands now. I really believe all this stuff. I hope you find it at least amusing.

to a zero, which is not nothing, but a starting point, where life can begin.

In our daily lives, for the most part, time is also conserved. We get up in the morning, go to school, or work, or whatever, do whatever we do, and eventually go home at night to the same bed. A circle in space and time. In this case, it is possible to consider that bed as the time source, so however far you traveled from it, time was conserved and you went back. Any paths that involve closed paths conserve time. The earth's orbit around the sun is such a path. Each of our own paths around the axis of the earth as it spins each day is another such path.

If you take a bottle of baby shampoo and shake it, lots of bubbles of all different sizes will appear uniformly. If the bottle is left to settle, the larger bubbles quickly move to the surface of the liquid, while the smaller bubbles will move more slowly upward. This is more than just a weird way to bide your time in the shower, it is an interesting case of Conservation of Time. What we see as the bubble is actually only the absence of shampoo. The bubble is defined by the liquid along the outside of it. What we see as the bubble moving up is actually the liquid moving down. Time is conserved. This is also a good example of the vector property of time. General Relativity shows that in a gravitational field, time is directed opposite the force of gravity. This is illustrated by the bubbles moving up. Other examples of time vectors are candles, where the flame always points up, regardless of the orientation of the wick, trees and other plants which grow up regardless of the tilt of the ground they are on, and the magnetic field of the earth, which is far longer away from the sun than towards it. (like a flame.)

Before I begin discussing philosophical implications of Conservation of time, I must include a brief description of some of the scientific aspects.

As I stated the conservation, it sounds a great deal like Newton's third law, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." Newton's actions and reactions pertain to masses and forces, and since Einstein related mass and time, they are indeed equivalent statements. Newton, then, should be credited with the first Conservation of Time theory.

In the world of common experience, the vast majority of particles encountered are electrically neutral, which means that there are an equal number of negative charges and positive charges. Applying Conservation of Time, this seems to indicate that one charge moves in one direction in time, the other in the opposite direction. With an equal number of each, overall time is conserved. Looking at the structure of the atom, this seems likely enough. The center of mass of an atom is in the nucleus which is positive, and the electron which is heading away from the nucleus is negative. The nucleus is the time source for the atom, and the electron rides an isochrone, at rest in time. To move to a higher energy level, which means moving ahead in time and farther away from the nucleus, the electron needs to receive energy. If it moves back in time, it loses energy. Also, two electrons with opposite spins in the same orbital are going opposite directions in time from each other. This simplifies the Pauli Exclusion Principle to the commonsense phrasing, only one particle is allowed to be at one place at one time. Each electron orbital is only one place, but two times, each opposite the other. This of course conserves time.

Free neutrons decay in just a few minutes to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. In a nucleus, neutrons supposedly become stable. I believe that actually the strong nuclear force does not cause the neutron to become stable, but bends, curves, and changes time so that time in the nucleus is either halted or slowed down a great deal.

The philosophical implications are many and varied, and at least as important as the scientific implications. I will try to touch on the more important points.

It seems to me that many philosophers could look through all scientific knowledge known to man, seeing every fact meticulously defined by mathematical equation and proven by careful experiment, and still say when they are done, "Terrific, but it doesn't say anything about human consciousness." I cannot separate myself that completely from the universe. My own existence is no different than that of a tree, or an electron, or a quasar. My body and my mind function due to certain principles which might not be fully understood, but I will not limit my own curiosity by saying that they are unknowable. Even if I can't understand something, or no one alive today can understand something, dare I tell future generations that they needn't bother trying? Certainly not. I believe that in time there is nothing that man cannot know or do, so long as

**Key Concepts:** consciousness, experience, being, time, self

**Written Language and Text Consciousness**

The distinction between modern humans and Paleolithic humans is not physical, it is psychological. We now *think in written language*.

By “think in a written language” I mean that we use language as more than a means of expressing ourselves to other people. More than describing events which we’ve witnessed. I use narratives to describe *myself* to *myself*.

Words are a vocabulary shared with all who know the same language, but the *specifics* of what it means are distinct for each person who knows the word. Further, each person uses each word in a different way with each person they interact with.

---

**The modern human uses a model of the world**

that serves the same function as the Paleolithic. Our model of the world works the same as most animals'—when we learn something about the world, we change what we know about the world as we act accordingly.

The model gives us a way of knowing the world around us, of *feeling* physically where we should move, how we should move, what we should do, what we should expect.

[Diagram: event → Awareness → Action → event]

---

**Text is resonated in the consciousness when it is recognized.**  
Thus is the creation of a meaningful text, against the backdrop of a discourse.

---

**We use the same mind to understand the world, but narrative creates the foundation on which our experience of the world is built.**  
The stories we are told and all the media we are exposed to create an environment which seem to imply that the world, as well as our spectrum of expression, are defined by authorities outside and superior in power and time precedence.

---

**Human beings before written language**

used their extraordinary powers of observation and correlation to create an enormously complex model of the world from direct interaction with physicality as well as interactions with other humans, and seeing how they made use of their body, their tools and resources in the environment.

Note that before written language, the basis of the “Paleolithic science” is personal experience, with any communicated knowledge augmented by the personal knowledge base.

---

**Beings exist within a Conservation of Emptiness**

Beings act like a “Box of Emptiness.” Everything within the Being—Receive–Process–Act—results in a new state of Quiescence.

Beings, like animals, have sophisticated senses to receive relevant events, process them in a sophisticated model of the world, and act to make changes to the world in the interest of the Being body.

---

**Meaning**  
An event where a state of Being is changed.

On a small scale — like temperature — being the average energy of the multitude of tiny component molecules.

On a large scale — like gravity — where the movement of mass or energy changes the contour of spacetime throughout the visible universe.

Beings work like this on all levels.

The mechanisms of exactly how it works at different levels differs in details, but it typically includes each being made up of smaller beings, with a simplified order than the larger composite beings.

---

**All Beings are receiving changes from a world outside.**  
All meaningful changes are available (?)

Received energy is perceived as events in the world, evidence in changes in the world.

The act of processing the state change is analogous to each Being maintaining a model of the World, and keeping it updated to match.

Receiving and Processing result in *Acting*.

**Today I will finish a draft — of something!?!**

A first person investigative narrative, following my thought process, touching on all the critical points. I can explain it to people in an hour; I will put it all out — at least outlined — before I leave for Thanksgiving.

- Awareness is primal. The *Now*. Planck bubble. The Emptying.
- Beings are Awareness and Bodies.
- Human Beings amplify the primitive universal awareness through the energy of the body including the nervous system and circulatory system.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.

**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.

**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions to allow as many engineering disciplines to create an incredibly large pool of useful (page not so clear) objects.

What the formalism does not do is make any positive statement about what the ultimate top-level forces which engineering can use actually is unilaterally, traditional scientists have to stay agnostic. It means groups of scientists' action around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity and Time & Consciousness. But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

I need to have a formalism to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describe my frame of reference of the universe which can be extended into levels of Being, each described in compatible vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no limit to the number of levels.

From first principles, the evidence will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully prioritized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.

Target Audience

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being of sorts, inevitably is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story these words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions and other psychological objects which the story of a person's Epistemology of the word meaning is of meaning in our life, and what the word itself means is meaningful.

Epistemology is in relationship with every person's semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is real and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying expectation of what it means to "BE" is called Ontology.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important, I don't want to exclude anyone because of the words I use but it is equally important to Be Precise, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

I can read books which tell me stories about history, which inform me about how models were built and discovered by science…

But for me to read these books even if I learned things I could use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my intention, and my conscious context at the current moment.

Consciousness is a name for my mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state. I am seeing through to encounter the world now, consciousness only happens now, and in this way, consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as the subject of consciousness. Consciousness is the first-person experience.

Journaling the veracity of my journals.

January 24th  
Ada’s Birthday, 101 years.  
A fitting beginning to my reverberation.

My parent’s half Anniversary (halfway around the year from July 24th)

So, I’m done with Roofvents.com, I’m going in tomorrow to give them back their bucket and tell them I am not available to work for them at $100/hr, not at $200/hr. I am not available. Not interested. If they won’t let me fix the underlying problems with the site on a weekly basis, so I’m not interested in fixing the surface cracks. I am done with Martin & Ethan.

The New Humanizer.com edition  

We the Humans of the Planet Earth declare our independence from the Legal, Social, and Spiritual responsibilities of Personhood.

Human Beings are corporeal biological living beings. Along with the presence of charge, that is, lived experience are under no obligation to constrain their expression of their deepest and essential identity.

The person (as eloquently described by Alan Watts) is the embodiment of the Greek word *persona*, which was the mask used in ancient Greek theater. The mask was often shaped to also serve as a megaphone. In the current theater of the world, to me, contains that connotation as well, the words a person speaks = *per sona* like through sound!

But not just any sound. Words, people, are expected by their social obligations and expectations to do certain things and not do others through penalty from other People.

This is a declaration that there is another way. We are all first a Being, then a Human Being, then a Being in a world of Many Beings of a wide spectrum of lived experiences which teach and empower everyone to the single underlying experience of Time. The change from one experienced moment to the next is what Conscious feels like. Underneath every scrap of context, every sensation from our body or an image imagined, the presence of a force of change in the present is exactly the part of the experience that we experience that absolute inevitability which is Being. The collapse of the Wave Equation is outside of the formalism but we can understand it, because it is what our consciousness is made of.

A human who must read into every action they perform as if they were a *persona* is trapped in a puzzle of words! Words not resulting in a person’s belief that stories about what other people think of you will determine all the failures, the successes. You are not obliged to remember the rules. You’ve done what you’ve done, and what others will think of them after.

People go through seduction and betrayal with every belief.

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it. So here I am, on a plane for the first time in 13+ years with Mom, flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Coop... and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A consciousness first ontology."

Ontology is "the study of Being," Being & the action of existence. It also can refer to a being which is the subject experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own life in particular.

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of felt characteristics of existence.

The world is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in a moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness interpreted through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

I'm thinking about the questions surrounding ontology. All experience supplies evidence of Being which is to say of existence. In this way, since experience implies a conscious experience, then Ontology is only accessible through Consciousness.

But what about Being of other people... and other Beings that are not people. And what about

Ontology of Consciousness

An acknowledgment of the Primacy of Consciousness in the Existence of Being, called Ontology.

To be ontic means it is a moment of experienced existence. To be existential is to experience existence in a lived moment.

"To study ontology" is a strange phrase to decode because the essence of ontology is that it can also be used
