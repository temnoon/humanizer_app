Chapter 2
General features and some simple examples
2.1 The general computational process
A suitably programmed quantum computer should act on a number x toproduceanothernumber f(x)forsomespecifiedfunction f.Appro- priately interpreted, with an accuracy that increases with increasing k, we can treat such numbers as non-negative integers less than 2k. Each integer is represented in the quantum computer by the corresponding computational-basis state of k Qbits.
If we specify the numbers x as n-bit integers and the numbers f (x) as m -bit integers, then we shall need at least n + m Qbits: a set of n-Qbits, called the input register, to represent x, and another set of m- Qbits, called the output register, to represent f (x). Qbits being a scarce commodity, you might wonder why we need separate registers for input and output. One important reason is that if f (x) assigns the same value to different values of x, as many interesting functions do, then the computation cannot be inverted if its only effect is to transform the contentsofasingleregisterfromxto f(x).Havingseparateregistersfor input and output is standard practice in the classical theory of reversible computation. Since quantum computers must operate reversibly to perform their magic (except for measurement gates), they are generally designed to operate with both input and output registers. We shall find that this dual-register architecture can also be usefully exploited by a quantum computer in some strikingly nonclassical ways.
The computational process will generally require many Qbits be- sides the n + m in the input and output registers, but we shall ignore these additional Qbits for now, viewing a computation of f as doing nothing more than applying a unitary transformation, U f , to the n + m Qbits of the input and output registers. We take up the fundamental question of why the additional Qbits can be ignored in Section 2.3, only noting for now that it is the reversibility of the computation that makes this possible.
We define the transformation U f by specifying it as a reversible transformation taking computational-basis states into computational- basis states. As noted in Section 1.6, the linear extension of such a classically meaningful transformation to arbitrary complex superpo- sitions of computational-basis states is necessarily unitary. The stan- dard quantum-computational protocol, which we shall use repeatedly,

2.1 THE GENERAL COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS 37
 definestheactionofUf onthecomputational-basisstates|x⟩n|y⟩m of the n + m Qbits making up the input and output registers as follows:
Uf |x⟩n|y⟩m =|x⟩n|y⊕ f(x)⟩m, (2.1)
where ⊕ indicates modulo-2 bitwise addition (without carrying) or, if you prefer, the bitwise exclusive OR. If x and y are m-bit integers whose jth bits are xj and yj , then x ⊕ y is the m-bit integer whose jth bit is x j ⊕ y j . Thus 1101 ⊕ 0111 = 1010. This is a straightforward generalization of the single-bit ⊕ defined in Section 1.3.
If the initial value represented by the output register is y = 0 then we have
U f |x⟩n |0⟩m = |x⟩n | f (x)⟩m (2.2)
and we do indeed end up with f (x) in the output register. Regardless of the initial value of y, the input register remains in its initial state |x⟩n.
Thetransformation(2.1)isclearlyinvertible.Indeed,Uf isitsown inverse:
UfUf |x⟩|y⟩ =Uf |x⟩|y⊕ f(x)⟩
= |x⟩|y ⊕ f (x) ⊕ f (x)⟩ = |x⟩|y⟩, (2.3)
since z ⊕ z = 0 for any z. (From this point on I shall use subscripts that specify the numbers of Qbits only when it is important to emphasize what those numbers are.)
The form (2.2) inspires the most important trick of the quantum- computational repertoire. If we apply to each Qbit in the 2-Qbit state |0⟩|0⟩ the 1-Qbit Hadamard transformation H (Equation (1.45)), then we get
= √1 |0⟩+|1⟩ √1 22
|0⟩+|1⟩
= 1 |0⟩|0⟩ + |0⟩|1⟩ + |1⟩|0⟩ + |1⟩|1⟩
2
= 1 |0⟩2 +|1⟩2 +|2⟩2 +|3⟩2 . 2
(2.4) This clearly generalizes to the n-fold tensor product of n Hadamards,
applied to the n -Qbit state |0⟩n : H⊗n|0⟩n = 1
|x⟩n,

(2.6)
2n /2
0≤x<2n
H⊗n =H⊗H⊗···⊗H, ntimes.
So if the initial state of the input register is |0⟩n and we apply an n-fold Hadamard transformation to that register, its state becomes an equally

 weighted superposition of all possible n-Qbit inputs. If we then apply Uf tothatsuperposition,with0initiallyintheoutputregister,then by linearity we get from (2.5) and (2.2)
Uf H⊗n ⊗1m |0⟩n|0⟩m = 1 2n /2
Uf |x⟩n|0⟩m
|x⟩n|f(x)⟩m. (2.7)
This contains an important part of the magic that underlies quantum computation. If before letting U f act, we merely apply a Hadamard transformation to every Qbit of the input register, initially in the stan- dard state |0⟩n , the result of the computation is described by a state whose structure cannot be explicitly specified without knowing the result of all 2n evaluations of the function f . So if we have a mere hundred Qbits in the input register, initially all in the state |0⟩100 (and m more in the ouput register), if a hundred Hadamard gates act on the input register before the application of U f , then the form of the final state contains the results of 2100 ≈ 1030 evaluations of the function f . A billion billion trillion evaluations! This apparent miracle is called quantum parallelism.
But a major part of the miracle is only apparent. One cannot say that the result of the calculation is 2n evaluations of f , though some practitioners of quantum computation are rather careless about making such a claim. All one can say is that those evaluations characterize the form of the state that describes the output of the computation. One knows what the state is only if one already knows the numerical values of all those 2n evaluations of f . Before drawing extravagant practical, or even only metaphysical, conclusions from quantum parallelism, it is essential to remember that when you have a collection of Qbits in a definite but unknown state, there is no way to find out what that state is.
If there were a way to learn the state of such a set of Qbits, then every- one could join in the rhapsodic chorus. (Typical verses: “Where were all those calculations done? In parallel universes!” “The possibility of quantum computation has established the existence of the multiverse.” “Quantum computation achieves its power by dividing the computa- tional task among huge numbers of parallel worlds.”) But there is no way to learn the state. The only way to extract any information from Qbits is to subject them to a measurement.
When we send all n + m Qbits through measurement gates, the Born rule tells us that if the state of the registers has the form (2.7), then with equal probability the result of measuring the Qbits in the input register will be any one of the values of x less than 2n, while the result of measuring the Qbits in the ouput register will be the value of f for that particular value of x. So by measuring the Qbits we can learn a single value of f as well as learning a single (random)

0≤x<2n

2.1 THE GENERAL COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS 39
 x0 at which f has that value. After the measurement the state of the registers reduces to |x0⟩| f (x0)⟩ and we are no longer able to learn anything about the values of f for any other values of x. So although we can learn something from the output of the “parallel computation,” it is nothing more than what we would have learned had we simply run the computation starting with a classical state |x⟩ in the input register, with the value of x chosen randomly. That, of course, could have been done with an ordinary classical computer.
To be sure, a hint of a miracle remains – hardly more than the smile of the Cheshire cat – in the fact that in the quantum case the random selection of the x, for which f (x) can be learned, is made only after the computation has been carried out. (To assert that the selection was made before the computation was done is to make the same error as asserting that a Qbit described by a superposition of the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ is actually in one or the other of them, as discussed in Section 1.8.) This is a characteristic instance of what journalists like to call “quantum weirdness,” in that (a) it is indeed vexing to contemplate the fact that the choice of the value of x for which f can be learned is made only after – quite possibly long after – the computation has been finished, but (b) since that choice is inherently random – beyond anyone’s power to control in any way whatever – it does not matter for any practical purpose whether the selection was made astonishingly after or boringly before the calculation was executed.
If, of course, there were an easy way to make copies of the output state prior to making the measurement, without running the whole computation over again, then one could, with high probability, learn the values of f for several different (random) values of x. But such copying is prohibited by an elementary result called the “no-cloning theorem,” which states that there is no such duplication procedure: thereisnounitarytransformationthatcantakethestate|ψ⟩n|0⟩n into thestate|ψ⟩n|ψ⟩n forarbitrary|ψ⟩n.
The no-cloning theorem is an immediate consequence of linearity. If
U |ψ⟩|0⟩) = |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ and U |φ⟩|0⟩) = |φ⟩|φ⟩, (2.8) then it follows from linearity that
U a|ψ⟩ + b|φ⟩ |0⟩ = aU|ψ⟩|0⟩ + bU|φ⟩|0⟩ = a|ψ⟩|ψ⟩ + b|φ⟩|φ⟩. (2.9)
But if U cloned arbitrary inputs, we would have
U a|ψ⟩+b|φ⟩ |0⟩= a|ψ⟩+b|φ⟩ a|ψ⟩+b|φ⟩
= a2|ψ⟩|ψ⟩ + b2|φ⟩|φ⟩ + ab|ψ⟩|φ⟩ + ab|φ⟩|ψ⟩,
(2.10)

40 GENERAL FEATURES AND SOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES
 which differs from (2.9) unless one of a and b is zero. Surprisingly, this very simple theorem was not proved until half a century after the discovery of quantum mechanics, presumably because it took that long for it to occur to somebody that it was an interesting proposition to formulate.
Of course, the ability to clone to a reasonable degree of approxima- tion would be quite useful. But this is also impossible. Suppose that U approximately cloned both |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩:
U |ψ⟩|0⟩) ≈ |ψ⟩|ψ⟩ and U |φ⟩|0⟩) ≈ |φ⟩|φ⟩. (2.11)
Then since unitary transformations preserve inner products, since the inner product of a tensor product of states is the (ordinary) product of their inner products, and since ⟨0|0⟩ = 1, it follows from (2.11) that
⟨φ|ψ⟩ ≈ ⟨φ|ψ⟩2. (2.12)
But this requires ⟨φ|ψ⟩ to be either close to 1 or close to 0. Hence a unitary transformation can come close to cloning both of two states |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ only if the states are very nearly the same, or very close to being orthogonal. In all other cases at least one of the two states will be badly copied.
If this were the full story, nobody but a few philosophers would be interested in quantum computation. The National Security Agency of the United States of America is interested because there are more clever things one can do. Typically these involve applying additional unitary gates to one or both of the input and output registers before and/or after applying U f , sometimes intermingled with intermediate measurement gates acting on subsets of the Qbits. All these additional gates are cunningly chosen so that when one finally does measure all the Qbits, one extracts useful information about relations between the values of f for several different values of x, which a classical computer could get only by making several independent evaluations. The price one inevitably pays for this relational information is the loss of the possibility of learning the actual value f (x) for any individual x. This tradeoff of one kind of information for another is typical of quantum computation, and typical of quantum physics in general, where it is called the uncertainty principle. The principle was first enunciated by Werner Heisenberg in the context of mechanical information – the position of a particle versus its momentum.
So it is wrong and deeply misleading to say that in the process that assigns the state (2.7) to the Qbits, the quantum computer has evaluated the function f (x) for all x in the range 0 ≤ x < 2n . Such assertions are based on the mistaken view that the quantum state encodes a property inherent in the Qbits. The state encodes only the possibilities available for the extraction of information from those Qbits. You should keep this in mind as we examine some of the specific ways in which this

nevertheless permits a quantum computer to perform tricks that no classical computer can accomplish.
2.2 Deutsch’s problem
Deutsch’s problem is the simplest example of a quantum tradeoff that sacrifices particular information to acquire relational information. A crude version of it appeared in a 1985 paper by David Deutsch that, together with a 1982 paper by Richard Feynman, launched the whole field. In that early version the trick could be executed successfully only half the time. It took a while for people to realize that the trick could be accomplished every single time. Here is how it works.
Let both input and output registers each contain only one Qbit, so we are exploring functions f that take a single bit into a single bit. There are two rather different ways to think about such functions.
(1) The first way is to note that there are just four such functions, as shown in Table 2.1. Suppose that we are given a black box that calcu- lates one of these four functions in the usual quantum-computational format, by performing the unitary transformation
U f |x⟩|y⟩ = |x⟩|y ⊕ f (x)⟩, (2.13)
where the state on the left is that of the 1-Qbit input register (i), and the state on the right is that of the 1-Qbit output register (o). Using the forms in Table 2.1 and the explicit structure (2.13) of U f , you can easily confirm that
U = 1, U = C , U = C X , U = X , (2.14) f0 f1 io f2 ioo f3 o
where 1 is the (2-Qbit) unit operator, Ci o is the controlled-NOT with theinputQbitascontrolandtheoutputastarget,andXo actsasNOT on the output register. These possibilities are illustrated in the circuit diagram of Figure 2.1.
SupposethatwearegivenablackboxthatexecutesUf foroneof the four functions, but are not told which of the four operations (2.14) the box carries out. We can, of course, find out by letting the black box

gates, each of the black boxesUf thatrealizethe four possible functions f that appear in Deutsch’s problem. In case 00 f is identically 0 and it is evident from the general form at the top of the figure thatUf actsastheidentity. Incase01 f(x)=x,soUf acts as cNOT, with the input register as the control Qbit. In case 10 f interchanges 0 and 1, so
Uf appliesNOTtothe target Qbit if and only if the computational-basis state of the control Qbit is |0⟩. This is equivalent to combining a cNOT with an unconditional NOT on the target Qbit. In case 11 f is identically 1, and the effect ofUf isjusttoapplyNOT to the output register, whatever the state of the input register. Note the diagrammatic convention for controlled operations: the control Qbit is represented by the wire with the black dot on it; the target Qbit is connected to the control by a vertical line ending in a box containing the controlled operation. An alternative representation for cNOT appears in Figure 2.7.

act twice – first on |0⟩|0⟩ and then on |1⟩|0⟩. But suppose that we can only let the box act once. What can we learn about f ?
In a classical computer, where we are effectively restricted to letting the black box act on Qbits in one of the four computational-basis states, we can learn either the value of f (0) (if we let U f act on either |0⟩|0⟩ or |0⟩|1⟩) or the value of f (1) (if we let U f act on either |1⟩|0⟩ or |1⟩|1⟩). If we choose to learn the value of f (0), then we can restrict f to being either f0 or f1 (if f(0)=0)ortobeingeither f2 or f3 (if f(0)=1). If we choose to learn the value of f (1), then we can restrict f to being either f0 or f2 (if f(1)=0)ortobeingeither f1 or f3 (if f(1)=1).
Suppose, however, that we want to learn whether f is constant (f(0) = f(1), satisfied by f0 and f3) or not constant (f(0) ̸= f(1), satisfied by f1 and f2). We then have no choice with a classical computer but to evaluate both f (0) and f (1) and compare them. In this way we determinewhetherornot f isconstant,butwehavetoextractcomplete information about f to do so. We have to run U f twice.
Remarkably, it turns out that with a quantum computer we do not have to run U f twice to determine whether or not f is constant. We can do this in a single run. Interestingly, when we do this we learn nothing whatever about the individual values of f (0) and f (1), but we are nevertheless able to answer the question about their relative values: whether or not they are the same. Thus we get less information than we get in answering the question with a classical computer, but by renouncing the possibility of acquiring that part of the information which is irrelevant to the question we wish to answer, we can get the answer with only a single application of the black box.

(2) There is a second way to look at Deutsch’s problem, which gives it nontrivial mathematical content. One can think of x as specifying a choice of two different inputs to an elaborate subroutine that requires many additional Qbits, and one can think of f (x) as characterizing a two-valued property of the output of that subroutine. For example
f (x) might be the value of the millionth bit in the binary expansion of √√
2 + x so that f (0) is the millionth bit in the expansion of 2 while √
f (1) is the millionth bit of 3. In this case the input register feeds data into the subroutine and the subroutine reports back to the output register.
In the course of the calculation the input and output registers will in general become entangled with the additional Qbits used by the sub- routine. If the entanglement persists to the end of the calculation, the input and output registers will have no final states of their own, and it will be impossible to describe the computational process as the simple unitary transformation (2.1). We shall see in Section 2.3, however, that it is possible to set things up so that at the end of the computation the additional Qbits required for the subroutine are no longer entangled with the input and output registers, so that the additional Qbits can in- deed be ignored. The simple linear transformation (2.1) then correctly characterizes the net effect of the computation on those two registers.
Under interpretation (1) of Deutsch’s problem, answering the ques-
tion of whether f is or is not constant amounts to learning something
about the nature of the black box that executes U f without actually
opening it up and looking inside. Under interpretation (2) it becomes
the nontrivial question of whether the millionth bits of 2 and 3 agree or disagree. Under either interpretation, to answer the question with a classical computer we can do no better than to run the black box twice, with both 0 and 1 as inputs, and compare the two outputs.
In the quantum case we could try the standard trick, preparing the
√
input register in the superposition (1/ 2) |0⟩ + |1⟩ . After a single
applicationofUf thefinalstateofthe1-Qbitinputandoutputregisters would then be
Uf H⊗1 |0⟩|0⟩ = √1 |0⟩|f(0)⟩+ √1 |1⟩|f(1)⟩, (2.15) 22
as described in (2.7). If we then measured the input and ouput registers
we could learn, under case (2), the millionth bit of either 2 or 3, as well as learning which we had learned. The choice of which we did learn would be random. This procedure offers no improvement on the classical situation.
It was first noticed that, without making any further use of U f , there are additional unitary transformations one can apply to the state (2.15) before carrying out the measurement that enable you half the time to state with assurance whether or not f (0) = f (1). (This imperfect solution to Deutsch’s problem has some interesting features, which we

 explore further in Appendix F.) Some time later, it was realized that you can always answer the question if you apply appropriate unitary transformations before as well as after the single application of U f . Here is how the trick is done.
Togettheoutput(2.15)wetooktheinputtoUf tobethestate
H ⊗ 1 |0⟩|0⟩ . (2.16)
Instead of doing this, we again start with both input and output registers
in the state |0⟩, but then we apply the NOT operation X to both
registers, followed by an application of the Hadamard transform to
√
both. Since X|0⟩ = |1⟩ and H|1⟩ = (1/ 2)(|0⟩ − |1⟩), the input to U f
is now described by the state
H⊗H X⊗X |0⟩|0⟩ = H⊗H |1⟩|1⟩

= √1 |0⟩−√1 |1⟩ √1 |0⟩−√1 |1⟩ 2222
= 1 |0⟩|0⟩ − |1⟩|0⟩ − |0⟩|1⟩ + |1⟩|1⟩ . 2
(2.17)
If we take the state (2.17) as input to U f , then by linearity the resulting state is
1 Uf (|0⟩|0⟩) − Uf (|1⟩|0⟩) − Uf (|0⟩|1⟩) + Uf (|1⟩|1⟩) . 2
It follows from the explicit form (2.13) of the action of U f computational-basis states that this is simply
(2.18) on the
1 |0⟩| f (0)⟩ − |1⟩| f (1)⟩ − |0⟩| f ̃(0)⟩ + |1⟩| f ̃(1)⟩ , 2
(2.19) where,asearlier,x ̃=1⊕xsothat1 ̃=0and0 ̃=1,and f ̃(x)=
1⊕ f(x).Soif f(0)= f(1)theouputstate(2.19)is
1 |0⟩−|1⟩ |f(0)⟩−|f ̃(0)⟩ , f(0)= f(1), (2.20)
2
but if f(0) ̸= f(1) then f(1) = f ̃(0), f ̃(1) = f(0), and the output state (2.19) becomes
1 |0⟩+|1⟩ |f(0)⟩−|f ̃(0)⟩ , f(0)̸= f(1). (2.21) 2
If, finally, we apply a Hadamard transformation to the input register, these become
|1⟩√1 |f(0)⟩−|f ̃(0)⟩, f(0)=f(1), (2.22) 2
|0⟩√1 |f(0)⟩−|f ̃(0)⟩, f(0)̸=f(1). (2.23) 2

Notice that in either case the output register is left in the state
√
(1/ 2)(| f (0)⟩ − | f ̃(0)⟩). Because the two terms in the superposition
have amplitudes with exactly the same magnitude, if one measures the output register the result is equally likely to be f (0) or f ̃(0), and one learns absolutely nothing about the actual value of f (0). The output register contains no useful information at all.
Another way to put it is that the final state of the output register
√
is±(1/ 2) |0⟩−|1⟩ dependingonwhether f(0)=0or f(0)=1.
Since a change in the overall sign of a state (or, more generally, the presence of an overall complex factor of modulus 1) has no effect on the statistical distribution of measurement outcomes, there is no way to distinguish between these two cases.
Thus the price one has paid to learn whether f (0) and f (1) are or are not the same is the loss of any information whatever about the actual value of either of them. One has still eliminated only two of the four possible forms for the function f . What the quantum computer gives us is the ability to make this particular discrimination with just a single invocation of the black box. No classical computer can do this.
There is a rather neat circuit-theoretic way of seeing why this trick enables one to learn whether or not f (0) = f (1) in just one application of U f , without going through any of the above algebraic manipulations. This quite different way of looking at Deutsch’s problem is illustrated in Figures 2.1–2.3. The basic idea is that for each of the four possible choices for the function f , the 2-Qbit unitary transformation U f be- haves in exactly the same way as the equivalent circuit constructed out of a NOT and/or a cNOT gate pictured in Figure 2.1. Consequently applying Hadamard gates to each Qbit, both before and after the ap- plication of U f , must produce exactly the same result as it would if the Hadamards were applied to the equivalent circuits in Figure 2.1. Using the elementary identities in Figure 2.2, one easily demonstrates that those results are as shown in Figure 2.3. But Figure 2.3 shows ex- plicitlythatwhenUf issosandwichedbetweenHadamards,theinput register ends up in the state |0⟩ if f (0) = f (1) and in the state |1⟩ if
f(0)̸= f(1).

Thus the state of the input register has ended up as |1⟩ or |0⟩ de- pending on whether or not f (0) = f (1), so by measuring the input register we can indeed answer the question of whether f (0) and f (1) are or are not the same!

of Deutsch’s problem, it is quite startling that one can do this with no
more effort (except for a simple modification of the initial and final
states) than one uses to calculate the millionth bit of either 2 or 3. In this case, however, there is an irritating catch, which we note at the end of Section 2.3.
2.3 Why additional Qbits needn’t mess things up
Now that we have a specific example of a quantum computation to keep in mind, we can address an important and very general issue mentioned in Section 2.1. The computational process generally requires the use of many Qbits besides the n + m in the input and output registers. In the second interpretation of Deutsch’s problem, it may need a great many more. The action of the computer is then described by a uni- tarytransformationWf thatactsonthespaceassociatedwithallthe Qbits: those in the input and output registers, together with the r additional Qbits used in calculating the function f . Only under very special circumstances will this global unitary transformation W f on all n + m + r Qbits induce a transformation on the input and output registersthatcanbebedescribedbyaunitarytransformationUf that acts only on those two registers, as in (2.1). In general the input and output registers will become entangled with the states of the additional r Qbits, and cannot even be assigned a state.

  We can get the action of Uf , when it is
preceded and followed by Hadamards on both Qbits, by applying the appropriate identities of Figure 2.2 to the diagrams of Figure 2.1. Case 00 is unchanged because of Figure 2.2(a). In case 01 the target and control Qbits of the cNOT are interchanged because of Figure 2.2(f). The form in case 10 follows from the corresponding form in Figure 2.1 because of Figures 2.2(f) and 2.2(b). The form in case 11 follows from Figures 2.2(a) and 2.2(b). If the initial state of the output register (lower wire) is |1⟩ and the initial state of the input register (upper wire) is either of the two computational-basis states, then the initial state of the input register will be unchanged in cases 00 and 11, and flipped in cases 01 and 10, so by measuring the input register after the action of

Let the additional r Qbits start off in some standard initial state |ψ ⟩r , so that the initial state of input register, output register, and additional Qbits is
|⟩n+m+r =|x⟩n|y⟩m|ψ⟩r. (2.25)
Although the r additional Qbits may well become entangled with those in the input and output registers in the course of the calculation – they will have to if they are to serve any useful purpose – we require that when the calculation is finished the final state of the computer must be of the form
Wf|⟩n+m+r =|x⟩n|y⊕ f(x)⟩m|φ⟩r, (2.26)
where the additional r Qbits not only are unentangled with the input andoutputregisters,butalsohaveastate|φ⟩r thatisindependentof the initial state of the input and output registers.
BecauseWf islinearonthewhole(n+m+r)-Qbitsubspace,and because |ψ⟩r and |φ⟩r are independent of the initial computational- basis state of the input and output registers, it follows that if the input and output registers are initially assigned any superposition of computational-basis states, then Wf leaves them with a definite final state, which is related to their initial state by precisely the unitary transformationUf of(2.1).

  Therefore we can indeed use (2.1), ignoring complications associated with the additional r Qbits needed to compute the function f , if both the initial and the final states of the additional Qbits are independent of the initial states of the input and output registers.

It is sometimes said that by using a quantum computer one can learn

single evaluation of f . This is true only under the first, arithmetically
uninteresting, interpretation of Deutsch’s problem. If, however, one is
thinking of f as a function of mathematical interest evaluated by an
elaborate subroutine, then to evaluate f for a single value of x there is
no need to undo the effect of the unitary transform V on the additional
of Cm , we can finally apply to them the inverse transformation V to restore them to their original state. We have thus produced the required unitary transformation W in (2.26), with the final state |φ⟩r of the r additional Qbits being identical to their initial state |ψ ⟩r .

  A more detailed picture of the Cm unitary transformation in Figure 2.6, for the case m = 5. Each of the input and output bars contains five Qbits, represented by sets of five thin lines (wires). Five different 2-Qbit controlled-NOT gates link the five upper wires representing f (x) to the five lower wires representing the corresponding positions in the output register. The action of a single such cNOT gate is shown in the lower part of the figure. Note the alternative convention for a cNOT gate: the black dot on the wire representing the control Qbit is connected by a vertical line to an open circle on the wire representing the target Qbit. The other convention (used above in Figures 2.1–2.3) replaces the open circle by a square box containing the NOT operator X that may act on the target Qbit. The advantages of the circle representation are that it suggests the symbol ⊕ that represents the XOR operation, and that it is easier to draw quickly on a blackboard. The advantages of using X are that it makes the algebraic relations more evident when NOT operations X, Z operations, or controlled-Z operations also appear, and that it follows the form used for all other controlled unitaries.
  2.4 The Bernstein–Vazirani problem
Like many of the examples discovered before Shor’s factoring algo- rithm, this has a somewhat artificial character. Its significance lies not in the intrinsic arithmetical interest of the problem, but in the fact that it can be solved dramatically and unambiguously faster on a quantum computer.
Let a be an unknown non-negative integer less than 2n . Let f (x) take any other such integer x into the modulo-2 sum of the products of corresponding bits of a and x, which we denote by a · x (in recognition of the fact that it is a kind of bitwise modulo-2 inner product):
a · x = a0 x0 ⊕ a1 x1 ⊕ a2 x2 · · ·. (2.27)

2.4 THE BERNSTEIN–VAZIRANI PROBLEM 51
 Suppose that we have a subroutine that evaluates f (x) = a · x. How many times do we have to call that subroutine to determine the value of the integer a? Here and in all subsequent examples, we shall assume that any Qbits acted on by such subroutines, except for the Qbits of the input and output registers, are returned to their initial state at the end of the computation, as discussed in Section 2.3.
Themthbitofa isa ·2m,sincethebinaryexpansionof2m has1in position m and 0 in all the other positions. So with a classical computer wecanlearnthenbitsofabyapplying f tothenvaluesx=2m,0≤ m < n. This, or any other classical method one can think of, requires n different invocations of the subroutine. But with a quantum computer a single invocation is enough to determine a completely, regardless of how big n is!
I first describe the conventional way of seeing how this can be done,
and then describe a much simpler way to understand the process. The
conventional way exploits a trick (implicitly exploited in our solution to
Deutsch’s problem) that is useful in dealing with functions like f that
act on n Qbits with output to a single Qbit. If the 1-Qbit output register √
is initially prepared in the state HX|0⟩ = H|1⟩ = (1/ 2) |0⟩ − |1⟩ then, since U f applied to the computational basis state |x⟩n |y⟩1 flips the value y of the output register if and only if f (x) = 1, we have
Uf|x⟩n√1 |0⟩−|1⟩ =(−1)f(x)|x⟩n√1 |0⟩−|1⟩ . (2.28) 22
√
So by taking the state of the 1-Qbit output register to be (1/ 2) |0⟩ −
|1⟩ , we convert a bit flip to an overall change of sign. This becomes useful because of a second trick, which exploits a generalization of the action(2.5)ofH⊗n on|0⟩n.
The action of H on a single Qbit can be compactly summarized as 111
H|x⟩1 = √ |0⟩ + (−1)x|1⟩ = √ (−1)xy|y⟩. (2.29) 2 2 y=0
If we apply H⊗n to an n-Qbit computational-basis state |x⟩n we can therefore express the result as
|yn−1⟩···|y0⟩ (2.30)
where the product x · y is the one defined in (2.27). (Because −1 is raised to the power x j y j , all that matters about the sum is its value modulo 2.)
So if we start with the n-Qbit input register in the standard initial state H⊗n |0⟩, put the 1-Qbit output register into the state H|1⟩, apply

At least one term in the product vanishes unless every bit yj of y is equal to the corresponding bit aj of a – i.e. unless y = a. Therefore the entire computational process (2.31) reduces to
H⊗(n+1)Uf H⊗(n+1)|0⟩n|1⟩1 = |a⟩n|1⟩1, (2.33)
where I have applied a final H to the 1-Qbit output register to make the final expression look a little neater and more symmetric. (I have also restored subscripts to the state symbols for the n-Qbit input register and 1-Qbit output register.)
So by putting the input and output registers into the appropriate initial states, after a single invocation of the subroutine followed by an application of H⊗n to the input register, the state of the input register becomes |a⟩. As promised, all n bits of the number a can now be determined by measuring the input register, even though we have called the subroutine only once!
There is a second, complementary way to look at the Bernstein– Vazirani problem that bypasses all of the preceding analysis, making it evident why (2.33) holds, by examining a few circuit diagrams. The

2.4 THE BERNSTEIN–VAZIRANI PROBLEM 53
  Fig 2.9
  The solution to the Bernstein–Vazirani
problem is to start with the input register in the state |0⟩n and the output register in the state |1⟩1 and apply Hadamard transforms to all n + 1 registers before applying U f . Another
n + 1 Hadamards are appliedafterUf hasacted. The cNOT gates reproduce the action of
U f , as shown in Figure 2.8. The conventional analysis deduces the final state by calculating the effect of the Hadamards on the initial state of the Qbits and on the state subsequently produced by the action of Uf . A much easier way to understand what is going on is to examine the effect of the Hadamards on the collection of cNOT gates equivalent to U f . This is shown in Figure 2.10.

                 idea is to note, just as we did for the black box of Deutsch’s problem in (2.14), that the actions of the black boxes that implement U f for the different available choices of f are identical to the actions of some simple circuits.
When f (x) = a · x, the action of U f on the computational basis is to flip the 1-Qbit output register once, whenever a bit of x and the corresponding bit of a are both 1. When the state of the input register is |x⟩n this action can be performed by a collection of cNOT gates all targeted on the output register. There is one cNOT for each nonzero bit of a, controlled by the Qbit representing the corresponding bit of x. The combined effect of these cNOT gates on every computational- basis state is precisely that of U f . Therefore the effect of any other transformationsprecedingand/orfollowingUf canbeunderstoodby examining their effect on this equivalent collection of cNOT gates, even thoughUf mayactuallybeimplementedinacompletelydifferentway.
The encoding of a in the disposition of the equivalent cNOT gates is illustrated in Figure 2.8. The application (2.33) of H to every Qbit in the input and output registers both before and after the application of U f , pictured in Figure 2.9, converts every cNOT gate in the equivalent representationofUf fromCij to HiHj Cij HiHj = Cji,aspictured in Figure 2.10 (see also Equation (1.44).) After this reversal of target and control Qbits, the output register controls every one of the cNOT gates, and since the state of the output register is |1⟩, every one of the NOT operators acts. That action flips just those Qbits of the input register for which the corresponding bit of a is 1. Since the input register starts in the state |0⟩n , this changes the state of each Qbit of the input register to |1⟩, if and only if it corresponds to a nonzero bit of a. As a result, the state of the input register changes from |0⟩n to |a ⟩n , just as (2.33) asserts.
Note how different these two explanations are. The first applies U f to the quantum superposition of all possible inputs, and then applies operations that lead to perfect destructive interference of all states in the superposition except for the one in which the input register is in the state |a⟩. The second suggests a specific mechanism for representing thesubroutinethatexecutesUf andthenshowsthatsandwichingsucha

  Sandwiching a cNOT gate between
Hadamards that act on the control and target Qbits has the effect of interchanging control and target, as shown at the top of the figure. (See Equation (1.44) or Figure 2.2.) Consequently the action of all the Hadamards in Figure 2.9 on the cNOT gates between them is simply to interchange the control and target Qbits, as shown in the lower part of the figure. In establishing this one uses the fact that H2 = 1, so that the H gates on wires that are not control or target Qbits combine to give 1, and pairs of Hadamards can be introduced between every X on the lowest wire, converting HXXXH into (HXH)(HXH)(HXH). After the action of the Hadamards the cNOT gates are controlled by the output register, so if the output register is in the state |1⟩ then all the X act on their input-register targets. If the initial state of the input register is |0⟩n then the effect of each X is to change to |1⟩ the state of each Qbit associated with a bit of a that is 1. This converts the state of the input register to |a ⟩n .

mechanism between Hadamards automatically imprints a on the input register.
Interestingly, quantum mechanics appears in the second method only because it allows the reversal of the control and target Qbits of a cNOT operation solely by means of 1-Qbit (Hadamard) gates. One can also reverse control and target bits of a cNOT classically, but this requires the use of 2-Qbit SWAP gates, rather than 1-Qbit Hadamards. You can confirm for yourself that this circuit-theoretic solution to the Bernstein–Vazirani problem no longer works if one tries to replace all the Hadamard gates by any arrangement of SWAP gates.
2.5 Simon’s problem
Simon’s problem, like the Bernstein–Vazirani problem, has an n-bit nonzero number a built into the action of a subroutine U f , and the aim is to learn the value of a with as few invocations of the subroutine as possible. In the Bernstein–Vazirani problem a classical computer must call the subroutine n times to determine the value of a , while a quantum computer need call the subroutine only once. The number of calls grows linearly with n in the classical case, while being independent of n in the quantum case. In Simon’s problem the speed-up with a quantum computer is substantially more dramatic. With a classical computer the number of times one must call the subroutine grows exponentially in n, but with a quantum computer it grows only linearly.
This spectacular speed-up involves a probabilistic element charac- teristic of many quantum computations. The characterization of how the number of calls of the subroutine scales with the number of bits in a applies not to calculating a directly, but to learning it with probability very close to 1.
       HXH
               =
          
The subroutine U f in Simon’s problem evaluates a function f on n bitsthatistwotoone–i.e.itisafunctionfromn ton −1bits.Itis constructed so that f (x) = f (y) if and only if the n-bit integers x and y are related by x = y ⊕ a or, equivalently and more symmetrically, x ⊕ y = a, where ⊕ again denotes bitwise modulo-2 addition. One can think of this as a period-finding problem. One is told that f is periodic under bitwise modulo-2 addition,
f(x⊕a)= f(x) (2.34)
for all x, and the problem is to find the period a. Simon’s problem is thus a precursor of Shor’s much subtler and spectacularly more useful period-finding algorithm – the heart of his factoring procedure – where one finds the unknown period a of a function that is periodic under ordinary addition: f (x + a) = f (x).
To find the value of a in (2.34) with a classical computer all you can do is feed the subroutine different x1, x2, x3, . . ., listing the resulting values of f until you stumble on an x j that yields one of the previously computed values f (xi ). You then know that a = x j ⊕ xi . At any stage of the process prior to success, if you have picked m different values of x, then all you know is that a ̸= xi ⊕ xj for all pairs of previously selectedvaluesofx.Youhavethereforeeliminatedatmost 12m(m −1) values of a. (You would have eliminated fewer values of a if you were careless enough to pick an x equal to xi ⊕ x j ⊕ xk for three values of x already selected.) Since there are 2n − 1 possibilities for a, your chances of success will not be appreciable while 12 m (m − 1) remains small compared with 2n . You are unlikely to succeed until m becomes of the order of 2n/2, so the number of times the subroutine has to be run to give an appreciable probability of determining a grows with the number of bits n as 2n/2 – i.e. exponentially. If a has 100 bits a classical computer would have to run the subroutine about 250 ≈ 1015 times to have a significant chance of determining a. At ten million calls per second it would take about three years.
In contrast, a quantum computer can determine a with high prob- ability (say less than one chance in a million of failing) by running the subroutine not very much more than n times – e.g. with about 120 invocations of the subroutine if a has 100 bits. This remarkable feat can be accomplished with the following strategy.

2.5 SIMON’S PROBLEM 55
 
56 GENERAL FEATURES AND SOME SIMPLE EXAMPLES
 If we now subject only the output register to a measurement, then the measurement gate is equally likely to indicate each of the 2n−1 different values of f . Since each value of f appears in two terms in (2.35) that have the same amplitudes, the generalized Born rule tells us that the input register will be left in the state
√1 |x0⟩+|x0⊕a⟩ (2.36) 2
for that value of x0 for which f (x0) agrees with the random value of f given by the measurement.
At first glance this looks like great progress. We have produced a superposition of just two computational-basis states, associated with two n-bit integers, that differ (in the sense of ⊕) by a. If we knew those two integers their bitwise modulo 2 sum would be a . But unfortunately, as already noted, when a register is in a given quantum state there is in general no way to learn what that state is. To be sure, if we could clone the state, then by measuring a mere ten copies of it in the computational basis we could with a probability of about 0.998 learn both x0 and x0 ⊕ a and therefore a itself. But unfortunately, as we have also noted earlier, one cannot clone an unknown quantum state. Nor does it help to run the algorithm many times, since we are overwhelmingly likely to get states of the form (2.36) for different random values of x0. By subjecting (2.36) to a direct measurement all we can learn is either x0 – a random number, or x0 ⊕ a – another random number. The number a that we would like to know appears only in the relation between two random numbers, only one of which we can learn.
Nevertheless, as in Deutsch’s problem, if we renounce the possibility of learning either number (which alone is of no interest at all), then by applying some further operations before measuring we can extract some useful partial information about their relationship – in this case their modulo-2 sum a. With the input register in the state (2.36), we apply the n -fold Hadamard transformation H⊗n . Equation (2.30) then gives

where the sum is now restricted to those y for which the modulo-2 bitwise inner product a · y is 0 rather than 1. So if we now measure the input register, we learn (with equal probability) any of the values of y

for which a · y = 0 – i.e. for which n−1
yiai =0(mod2), (2.39) i=0
where ai and yi are corresponding bits in the binary expansions of a and y.
This completes our description of the quantum computation: with eachinvocationofUf welearnarandomysatisfyinga·y=0.What remains is the purely mathematical demonstration that this information enables us to determine a with high probability with not many more than n invocations. To see that this is plausible, note first that with just a single invocation of U f , unless we are unlucky enough to get y = 0 (which happens with the very small probability 1/2n−1), we learn a nonzero value of y, and therefore a nontrivial subset of the n bits of a whose modulo-2 sum vanishes. One of those bits is thus entirely determined by the others in the subset, so we have cut the number of possiblechoicesforainhalf,from2n −1(the−1reflectingthefactthat we are told that a ̸= 0) to 2n−1 − 1. In one invocation of the subroutine we can, with very high probability, eliminate half the candidates for a! (Contrast this to the classical case, in which a single invocation of U f can tell us nothing whatever about a.)
If we now repeat the whole procedure, then with very high proba- bility the new value of y that we learn will be neither 0 nor the same as the value we learned the first time. We will therefore learn a new nontrivial relation among the bits of a, which enables us to reduce the number of candidates by another factor of 2, eliminating three quarters of the possibilities available for a with two invocations of the subrou- tine. (Compare this to the classical situation in which only a single value of a can be removed with two invocations.)
If every time we repeat the procedure we have a good chance of reducing the number of choices for a by another factor of 2, then with n invocations of the subroutine we might well expect to have a significant chance of learning a. This intuition is made precise in Appendix G, where some slightly subtle but purely mathematical analysis shows that with n + x invocations of U f the probability q of acquiring enough information to determine a is

q=1−11−1···1−1>1−1. 2n+x 2n+x−1 2x+2 2x+1

2.6 Constructing Toffoli gates
As noted in Section 1.6, constraints on what is physically feasible limit us to unitary transformations that can be built entirely out of 1- and 2-Qbit gates. It is assumed that 1-Qbit unitary gates will be rel- atively straightforward to make, though even this can be challenging for many of the physical systems proposed for Qbits. Making 2-Qbit gates presents an even tougher challenge to the quantum-computational en- gineer, since they will require one to manipulate with precision the physical interaction between the two Qbits. Making an inherently 3- Qbit gate goes beyond present hopes.
It has been known since before the arrival of quantum computa- tion that to build up all arithmetical operations on a reversible classical computer it is necessary (and sufficient) to use at least one classically irreducible 3-Qbit gate – for example controlled-controlled-NOT (cc- NOT) gates, known as Toffoli gates. Such 3-Qbit gates cannot be built up out of 1- and 2-Cbit gates. This would appear to be bad news for the prospects of practical quantum computation.
Remarkably, however, the linear extension of the Toffoli gate to Qbits can be built up out of 1-Qbit unitary gates acting in suitable combination with 2-Qbit cNOT gates. The quantum extension of this classically irreducible 3-Cbit gate can be realized with a rather small number of 1- and 2-Qbit gates.
The 3-Qbit Toffoli gate T acts on the computational basis to flip the state of the third (target) Qbit if and only if the states of both of the first two (control) Qbits) are 1:
T|x⟩|y⟩|z⟩ = |x⟩|y⟩|z ⊕ xy⟩. (2.41)
Since T is its own inverse, it is clearly reversible, and therefore its linear extension from the classical basis to arbitrary 3-Qbit states is unitary, by the general argument in Section 1.6.
The Toffoli gate enables one to calculate the logical AND of two bits (i.e. their product) since T|x⟩|y⟩|0⟩ = |x⟩|y⟩|xy⟩. Since all Boolean operations can be built up out of AND and NOT, and since all of arithmetic can be constructed out of Boolean operations, with Tof- foli gates one can build up all of classical computation through re- versible operations. (One can even produce NOT with a Toffoli gate: T|1⟩|1⟩|x⟩ = |1⟩|1⟩|x⟩, but this would be a ridiculously hard way to implement NOT on a quantum computer.)
There are (at least) two rather different ways to construct a ccNOT gate T out of cNOT gates and 1-Qbit unitaries. The first way to be

2.6 CONSTRUCTING TOFFOLI GATES 59
 found requires eight cNOT gates. Later a more efficient construction was discovered that requires only six cNOT gates. Nobody has found a construction with fewer than six cNOT gates, but I do not know of a proof that six are required. I describe both constructions, since they take advantage of and therefore illustrate several useful quantum- computational tricks.
The construction of a Toffoli gate from eight cNOT gates is based
on three ingredients. (a) For any 1-Qbit unitary U one defines the 2-
Qbitcontrolled-UgateCU asonethatactsonthecomputationalbasis 10
as the identity if the state of Qbit 1 (the control Qbit) is |0⟩ and acts on Qbit 0 (the target Qbit) as U if the state of the control Qbit is |1⟩:
CU |x1x0⟩ = Ux1 |x1x0⟩. (2.42) 10 0
(The cNOT operation C is thus a CX operation, but so important a
one as to make it the default form when no U is specified.) We shall
show that a controlled-U gate for arbitrary U can be built out of two
cNOT gates and 1-Qbit unitaries. (b) We shall show that a 3-Qbit
doubly-controlled-U2 gate,whichtakes|x2x1x0⟩into(U2x2x1)|x2x1x0⟩,
0
can be constructed out of two controlled-U gates, one controlled-U
†
gate, and two additional cNOT gates, making a total of eight cNOT gates. (c) We shall show that there is a unitary square-root-of-NOT
gate, X. Taking U in (b) to be X gives the desired Toffoli gate. We now elaborate on each part of the construction.
(a) Let V and W be two arbitrary 1-Qbit unitary transformations and consider the product

Alternatively, one can view this as a way to construct a Toffoli gate from four cNOT gates and a single controlled-phase gate of precisely the kind that plays a central role in the quantum Fourier transform de- scribed in Chapter 3. If quantum computation ever becomes a working technology, it might well be easier to construct controlled-phase gates as fundamental gates in their own right – pieces of 2-Qbit hardware as basic as cNOT gates.
As this and subsequent examples reveal, the cNOT gate is of funda- mental importance in quantum computation. Appendix H gives some examples of how such gates might actually be realized. That appendix is addressed primarily to physicists, but readers with other backgrounds might find it an interesting illustration of the rather different questions that arise when one starts thinking about how actually to produce some of the basic quantum-computational hardware.

Section 2.1, "The General Computational Process," outlines the foundational operations of quantum computing, focusing on the interaction between input, output, and the computational mechanism of quantum computers. This section elucidates the following key concepts:

1. **Quantum Computation Model**: It starts by explaining how a quantum computer processes information. Unlike classical computers that work with bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers operate on qubits (quantum bits). Qubits can exist in a state that represents 0, 1, or any quantum superposition of these states, enabling quantum computers to process a vast amount of data simultaneously.

2. **Unitary Transformation ($U_f$)**: The text introduces the concept of a unitary transformation $U_f$, a reversible operation critical in quantum computing. This transformation is applied to the qubits in the input and output registers, mapping the input state to the output state in a way that preserves the quantum information's total probability (the sum of the probabilities of all possible outcomes remains 1).

3. **Input and Output Registers**: The quantum computer uses two sets of qubits: the input register, which holds the initial state or the problem's input data, and the output register, which holds the result after computing. The necessity for separate input and output registers is emphasized, especially for functions where multiple inputs may yield the same output, ensuring the computation's reversibility—a fundamental requirement for quantum operations.

4. **Quantum Parallelism**: A significant portion of the discussion is dedicated to quantum parallelism, an inherent property of quantum computation that allows a quantum computer to evaluate a function $f(x)$ for many different values of $x$ simultaneously. This capability stems from the superposition principle, where a single quantum state can represent multiple classical states at once. Quantum parallelism is what theoretically enables quantum computers to solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical computers.

5. **Practical Implications and Challenges**: The section also touches upon the practical implications of these concepts, including the limitations and challenges inherent in harnessing quantum parallelism for computational tasks. While quantum computers can theoretically evaluate functions across a vast input space simultaneously, extracting specific useful information from this parallel computation often requires clever algorithm design and additional steps, like the interference pattern management and the probability amplitude manipulation.

In summary, Section 2.1 lays the groundwork for understanding how quantum computers leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. It introduces the reader to the abstract and counterintuitive nature of quantum information processing, setting the stage for deeper exploration into quantum algorithms and their applications.

Section 2.2, "Deutsch's Problem," delves into one of the earliest examples demonstrating the potential of quantum computing to solve problems more efficiently than classical computing. Deutsch's problem is a cornerstone in quantum computing, illustrating how quantum algorithms can exploit the principles of superposition and interference to achieve significant speed-ups for specific computational tasks. Here's an expanded explanation of this section:

1. **The Essence of Deutsch's Problem**: Deutsch's problem asks whether a given black box function (also known as an oracle) is constant (the same output for all inputs) or balanced (outputs half 0s and half 1s) across its entire domain. The function takes a single bit as input and produces a single bit as output, with only two possible functions: either it always returns 0 (or always 1), making it constant, or it returns 1 for one input and 0 for the other, making it balanced.

2. **Classical Approach Limitations**: Classically, to determine whether the function is constant or balanced, one would need to evaluate the function at least twice: once for each possible input (0 and 1). This is because, with classical computation, each function evaluation can only test one input at a time, and both outcomes are needed to distinguish between a constant and a balanced function.

3. **Quantum Solution**: The quantum approach to Deutsch's problem leverages a quantum algorithm that can solve the problem with a single query to the function. By preparing the input qubit in a superposition state, the algorithm applies the quantum version of the function (using a unitary transformation) to this superposition, effectively evaluating the function for both inputs simultaneously due to quantum parallelism.

4. **Interference and Measurement**: After the function is applied, additional quantum operations exploit interference effects to amplify the probability of an outcome that encodes the answer to Deutsch's problem. A measurement then reveals with certainty whether the function is constant or balanced, achieving what would classically require two separate function evaluations in just one quantum evaluation.

5. **Significance of Deutsch's Algorithm**: Deutsch's problem and its quantum solution are not only important for their specific application but also because they represent a fundamental shift in how we think about computation. Deutsch's algorithm was the first to show that quantum computers could, in principle, outperform classical computers for certain types of problems. It laid the groundwork for later developments in quantum algorithms, including Deutsch-Jozsa, Grover's search algorithm, and Shor's factoring algorithm.

6. **Technical Implementation**: The quantum algorithm for solving Deutsch's problem involves preparing the input and an auxiliary qubit in specific states, applying Hadamard gates to create superpositions, querying the oracle (function evaluation), applying another set of Hadamard gates, and finally measuring the outcome. The process makes use of quantum gates and entanglement to manipulate probabilities and extract the desired information efficiently.

In summary, Section 2.2 on Deutsch's Problem in quantum computing highlights a pivotal moment where quantum algorithms began to show their potential for solving problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. This problem exemplifies the quantum advantage, where the unique properties of quantum states—superposition, entanglement, and interference—are harnessed to perform tasks that challenge the boundaries of classical computing.

Section 2.3, "Why Additional Qbits Needn't Mess Things Up," explores a crucial aspect of quantum computing: the management of qubits beyond those directly involved in representing the input and output of a quantum computation. This section delves into how additional qubits (ancilla qubits) are utilized in quantum algorithms and the significance of maintaining the overall system's reversibility. Here's an expanded explanation:

1. **Role of Additional Qubits**: In quantum computing, additional qubits are often required for intermediate computations, to facilitate certain operations, or to ensure reversibility of quantum gates. These qubits can be part of complex quantum circuits that perform specific tasks, such as error correction, entanglement generation, or function evaluation within algorithms. The section emphasizes that, while the presence of these extra qubits might seem to complicate the quantum system, they are essential for expanding the computational capabilities of quantum computers.

2. **Reversibility of Quantum Computations**: One of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics is that the evolution of a closed quantum system is unitary, implying that it is reversible. This principle is crucial for quantum computing, where every computation must be reversible to preserve information and ensure coherence throughout the computation process. The section explains how additional qubits can be used without disrupting the reversible nature of quantum computations, highlighting the ingenuity behind quantum algorithm design.

3. **Simplification of the Computational Model**: Despite the introduction of additional qubits, quantum algorithms are designed to ensure that these qubits do not "mess things up." This is achieved by carefully orchestrating the computation so that the additional qubits are returned to their initial state at the end of the computation or are disentangled from the main computational qubits. This practice ensures that the additional qubits do not interfere with the final measurement outcomes of the algorithm and allows for a simplification of the overall computational model, focusing on the input and output qubits.

4. **Quantum Parallelism and Ancilla Qubits**: The section might also touch on the role of ancilla qubits in enabling quantum parallelism. By assisting in the creation of superposition states or entangled states, additional qubits can help leverage the parallel processing power of quantum computers, where multiple computational paths are explored simultaneously.

5. **Practical Implications**: Managing additional qubits effectively is not just a theoretical concern but has practical implications for quantum computer architecture and the physical implementation of quantum algorithms. Efficient use of qubits, including ancilla qubits, is essential given the current limitations in qubit numbers and coherence times in quantum processors. The section underscores the importance of optimizing the use of all qubits to maximize computational resources.

In essence, Section 2.3 sheds light on a nuanced aspect of quantum computing—how the clever management of additional qubits can enhance computational power without compromising the principles of quantum mechanics. It underscores the balance between utilizing ancilla qubits for complex operations and maintaining the reversibility and simplicity of the quantum computational model, a balance that is pivotal for the advancement of quantum computing technology.

Section 2.4, "The Bernstein–Vazirani Problem," further illustrates the power of quantum computing to solve problems more efficiently than classical approaches. This problem, like Deutsch's, involves discerning properties of a function, but it specifically focuses on identifying an unknown bit string from a given black box function. Here's an in-depth explanation:

1. **Problem Statement**: The Bernstein–Vazirani problem poses a challenge where one is given a black box function $f(x) = a \cdot x \, \text{mod} \, 2$, which computes the dot product of an unknown bit string $a$ (of length $n$) and an input bit string $x$, returning a single bit as output. The task is to determine the unknown bit string $a$ with the fewest possible queries to the function.

2. **Classical Approach Limitations**: Classically, identifying the unknown bit string $a$ would require querying the black box function $n$ times, with each query designed to reveal one bit of $a$. This is because each classical query can only evaluate the function for one specific input at a time, necessitating a separate query for each bit of $a$.

3. **Quantum Solution**: The quantum algorithm for solving the Bernstein–Vazirani problem can determine the unknown bit string $a$ in a single query. This remarkable efficiency is achieved by leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement. The algorithm starts by preparing the input qubits in a superposition of all possible states and then querying the black box function. Due to the properties of quantum mechanics, this single query effectively evaluates the function for all possible inputs simultaneously.

4. **Interference and Algorithm Details**: After the function is queried, the algorithm uses quantum interference to cancel out terms in such a way that the measurement outcome directly reveals the unknown bit string $a$. Specifically, the algorithm employs a sequence of Hadamard gates before and after querying the function, transforming the superposition in a manner that encodes $a$ in the phase of the quantum state. A subsequent measurement of the input qubits then yields $a$ directly.

5. **Significance and Implications**: The Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm is a pivotal example of quantum advantage, demonstrating that quantum algorithms can solve certain problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts. This problem and its quantum solution highlight the potential for quantum algorithms to outperform classical algorithms in tasks involving the analysis and manipulation of information.

6. **Technical Insights**: The solution to the Bernstein–Vazirani problem provides insights into the workings of quantum algorithms, showcasing how quantum properties like superposition and interference can be harnessed to process information in ways that are impossible classically. It also serves as a stepping stone to more complex quantum algorithms, further expanding our understanding of quantum computational capabilities.

In summary, Section 2.4 on the Bernstein–Vazirani Problem underscores the conceptual shift introduced by quantum computing in problem-solving strategies. By exploiting the unique aspects of quantum mechanics, quantum algorithms can achieve significant speed-ups over classical algorithms, even for problems as seemingly straightforward as identifying an unknown bit string from a black box function. This efficiency opens new avenues for exploring computational problems and designing algorithms that harness the full potential of quantum computing.

Section 2.5, "Simon’s Problem," delves into a quantum algorithm that showcases a substantial computational speedup over classical methods for a specific type of problem. Simon's problem introduces the concept of finding hidden periodicities within functions, a task for which quantum computing offers a uniquely powerful solution. Here’s an expanded explanation:

1. **Problem Overview**: Simon’s problem involves a black box function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$ that has a special property: there exists a non-zero bit string $s$ such that for all inputs $x$ and $y$, $f(x) = f(y)$ if and only if $x = y$ or $x = y \oplus s$, where $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR. The challenge is to determine the secret string $s$ with the fewest queries to the function.

2. **Classical Approach Limitations**: In a classical setting, finding the secret string $s$ requires exponentially many queries to the function in the worst case. This is because each query provides only a little information about $s$, and without a way to simultaneously compare multiple outputs, the process is inherently sequential and inefficient.

3. **Quantum Solution**: The quantum algorithm for Simon’s problem can find the secret string $s$ with a polynomial number of queries (specifically, $O(n)$ queries, where $n$ is the length of $s$). The quantum algorithm leverages superposition to query the black box function for all possible inputs at once, followed by a series of quantum Fourier transforms and measurements that reveal information about $s$.

4. **Interference and Entanglement**: Key to the quantum solution is the use of interference and entanglement to process information about the function’s periodicity. By preparing a superposition of all input states and applying the function $f$, the quantum algorithm creates an entangled state where the output is correlated with the input in a way that depends on $s$. Measuring part of this state collapses it in a manner that, with high probability, provides a non-trivial equation involving $s$. Repeating this process yields enough equations to solve for $s$ with simple linear algebra.

5. **Significance of Simon’s Algorithm**: Simon’s problem was one of the first to demonstrate that quantum computers could solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers. This revelation was a key milestone in the development of quantum computing, inspiring further research into quantum algorithms and their potential applications. Simon’s algorithm, in particular, laid the groundwork for Shor’s algorithm for factoring large numbers, a more famous example of quantum computational speedup with significant implications for cryptography.

6. **Technical Insights and Challenges**: The quantum algorithm for Simon’s problem illustrates the power of quantum mechanics to extract global properties of functions through interference patterns. It highlights the importance of quantum Fourier transform in processing quantum information and showcases the potential of quantum computing to tackle complex computational problems by exploiting the structure of quantum states.

In summary, Section 2.5 on Simon’s Problem exemplifies the transformative potential of quantum computing to address classes of problems that are intractable for classical computers. By harnessing quantum parallelism, entanglement, and interference, quantum algorithms can achieve exponential speedups in finding hidden periodicities within functions, opening new frontiers in computing and information processing.

Section 2.6, "Constructing Toffoli Gates," delves into the practical aspects of quantum computing by discussing the construction of Toffoli gates using simpler quantum gates. The Toffoli gate, a three-qubit gate, plays a critical role in quantum computing for its ability to implement classical logic within a quantum framework, crucial for algorithms that require conditional operations. Here's an expanded overview:

1. **Importance of Toffoli Gates**: The Toffoli gate, also known as the controlled-controlled-NOT gate (ccNOT), performs a NOT operation on one qubit (target) only when the other two qubits (controls) are in the state |1⟩. This gate is essential for realizing reversible computation, a necessity in quantum computing for operations that mimic classical logical functions like AND and OR, and for constructing complex quantum algorithms.

2. **Challenge in Constructing Toffoli Gates**: Directly implementing Toffoli gates in quantum systems is challenging because it requires precise control over three qubits simultaneously, a task that becomes increasingly difficult with the addition of each qubit due to decoherence and noise. Moreover, physical quantum computing platforms often primarily support one- and two-qubit operations due to technological constraints, necessitating the construction of Toffoli gates from these simpler operations.

3. **Solution Through Decomposition**: The section explains how Toffoli gates can be decomposed into a sequence of simpler one- and two-qubit gates, which are more readily implemented on quantum hardware. This decomposition demonstrates the ingenuity required to translate theoretical quantum operations into practical implementations. Two primary strategies are outlined for constructing Toffoli gates:

   - **Using Six cNOT Gates**: A more efficient method that requires six cNOT gates, alongside a handful of single-qubit gates. This approach is notable for its lower gate count, which is advantageous for minimizing quantum decoherence and operational errors in a quantum circuit.
   
   - **Using Eight cNOT Gates**: An alternative construction that involves eight cNOT gates. This method, while using more gates, provides a different perspective on how to achieve the desired ccNOT functionality through quantum gate decomposition.

4. **Technical Details and Quantum Gates**: The section likely details specific single-qubit gates (such as Hadamard, phase, and $\sqrt{X}$ gates) and how they're used in conjunction with cNOT gates to achieve the Toffoli gate's functionality. It highlights the importance of gate fidelity and the challenges of maintaining coherence throughout the operation.

5. **Significance for Quantum Computing**: Constructing Toffoli gates from simpler operations is not just a technical exercise; it's fundamental for executing quantum algorithms that require complex logic operations. It also underscores the importance of gate synthesis and optimization in quantum computing, areas that are critical for the development of scalable and practical quantum computers.

6. **Implications for Quantum Algorithm Design**: Understanding how to construct Toffoli gates from basic quantum gates is crucial for algorithm designers. It enables the implementation of sophisticated quantum algorithms within the constraints of current quantum technology, guiding the design towards more efficient and feasible quantum circuits.

In essence, Section 2.6 sheds light on the practical challenges and innovative solutions involved in realizing quantum computations that require complex logical operations. By detailing the construction of Toffoli gates from simpler quantum gates, it underscores the blend of theoretical insight and engineering ingenuity that drives progress in quantum computing technology.

Here is the text of Chapter 3. Please list the sections of this chapter.

Chapter 3
Breaking RSA encryption
3.1 Period finding, factoring, and cryptography
Simon’s problem (Section 2.5) starts with a subroutine that calculates a function f (x), which satisfies f (x) = f (y) for distinct x and y if and only if y = x ⊕ a, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise modulo-2 sum of the n-bit integers a and x. The number of times a classical computer must invoke the subroutine to determine a grows exponentially with n, but with a quantum computer it grows only linearly.
This is a rather artificial example, of interest primarily because it gives a simple demonstration of the remarkable computational power a quantum computer can possess. It amounts to finding the unknown period a of a function on n-bit integers that is “periodic” under bitwise modulo-2 addition. A more difficult, but much more natural problem is to find the period r of a function f on the integers that is periodic under ordinary addition, satisfying f (x) = f (y) for distinct x and y if and only if x and y differ by an integral multiple of r . Finding the period of such a periodic function turns out to be the key to factoring products of large prime numbers, a mathematically natural problem with quite practical applications.
One might think that finding the period of such a periodic function ought to be easy, but that is only because when one thinks of periodic functions one tends to picture slowly varying continuous functions (like the sine function) whose values at a small sample of points within a period can give powerful clues about what that period might be. But the kind of periodic function to keep in mind here is a function on the integers whose values within a period r are virtually random from one integer to the next, and therefore give no hint of the value of r .
The best known classical algorithms for finding the period r of such a function take a time that grows faster than any power of the number n of bits of r (exponentially with n1/3). But in 1994 Peter Shor discovered that one can exploit the power of a quantum computer to learn the period r , in a time that scales only a little faster than n3.
Because the ability to find periods efficiently, combined with some number-theoretic tricks, enables one to factor efficiently the prod- uct of two large prime numbers, Shor’s discovery of super-efficient quantum period finding is of considerable practical interest. The very great computational effort required by all known classical factorization

 techniques underlies the security of the widely used RSA1 method of encryption. Any computer that can efficiently find periods would be an enormous threat to the security of both military and commercial communications. This is why research into the feasibility of quantum computers is a matter of considerable interest in the worlds of war and business.
Although the elementary number-theoretic tricks that underlie the RSA method of encryption have nothing directly to do with how a quan- tum computer finds periods, they motivate the problem that Shor’s quantum-computational algorithm so effectively solves. Furthermore, examining the number-theoretic basis of RSA encryption reveals that Shor’s period-finding algorithm can be used to defeat it directly, with- out any detour into factoring. We therefore defer the number-theoretic connection between period finding and factoring to Section 3.10. If you are interested only in applying Shor’s period-finding algorithm to decoding RSA encryption, Section 3.10 can be skipped. If you are not interested in the application of period finding to commerce and espionage, you can also skip the number theory in Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and go directly to the quantum-computational part of the problem – super-efficient period finding – in Section 3.4.
3.2 Number-theoretic preliminaries
The basic algebraic entities behind RSA encryption are finite groups, where the group operation is multiplication modulo some fixed integer N. In modulo-N arithmetic all integers that differ by multiples of N are identified, so there are only N distinct quantities, which can be representedby0,1,..., N−1.Forexample5×6≡2(mod7)since 5 × 6 = 30 = 4 × 7 + 2. One writes ≡ (mod N) to emphasize that the equality is only up to a multiple of N, reserving = for strict equality. One can develop the results that follow using arithmetic rather than group theory, but the group-theoretic approach is simpler and uses properties of groups so elementary that they can be derived from the basic definitions in hardly more than a page. This is done in Appendix I, which readers unacquainted with elementary group theory should now read.
Let GN be the set of all positive integers less than N (including 1) that have no factors in common with N. Since factoring into primes is unique, the product of two numbers in GN (either the ordinary or the

RSA encryption was independently invented by Clifford Cocks four years earlier, but his discovery was classified top secret by British Intelligence and he was not allowed to reveal his priority until 1997. For this and other fascinating tales about cryptography, see Simon Singh, The Code Book, New York, Doubleday (1999).
 
3.2 NUMBER-THEORETIC PRELIMINARIES 65
 modulo-N product) also has no factors in common with N, so GN is closed under multiplication modulo N. If a, b, and c are in GN with ab ≡ ac (mod N), then a(b − c) is a multiple of N, and since a has no factors in common with N, it must be that b − c is a multiple of N, so b ≡ c (mod N). Thus the operation of multiplication modulo N by a fixed member a of GN takes distinct members of GN into distinct members, so the operation simply permutes the members of the finite set GN. Since 1 is a member of GN, there must be some d in GN satisfying ad = 1 – i.e. a must have a multiplicative inverse in GN. Thus GN satisfies the conditions, listed in Appendix I, for it to be a group under modulo-N multiplication.
Every member a of a finite group G is characterized by its order k, the smallest integer for which (in the case of GN)
ak ≡ 1 (mod N). (3.1)
As shown in Appendix I, the order of every member of G is a divisor of the number of members of G (the order of G). If p is a prime number, then the group G p contains p − 1 numbers, since no positive integer less than p has factors in common with p . Since p − 1 is then a multiple of the order k of any a in G p , it follows from (3.1) that any integer a less than p satisfies
ap−1 ≡1(modp). (3.2)
This relation, known as Fermat’s little theorem, extends to arbitrary integers a not divisible by p, since any such a is of the form a = mp + a′ with m an integer and a′ less than p.
RSA encryption exploits an extension of Fermat’s little theorem to a case characterized by two distinct primes, p and q . If an integer a is divisible neither by p nor by q , then no power of a is divisible by either
p or q. Since, in particular, aq−1 is not divisible by p, we conclude from (3.2) that
For the same reason
[aq−1]p−1 ≡1(modp). (3.3) [ap−1]q−1 ≡ 1 (mod q). (3.4)
Therelations(3.3)and(3.4)statethata(q−1)(p−1) −1isamultipleboth of p and of q . Since p and q are distinct primes, it must therefore be a multiple of p q , and therefore
a(q−1)(p−1) ≡ 1 (mod pq). (3.5)
(You are urged to check relations like (3.5) for yourself in special cases. If, for example p = 3 and q = 5 then (3.5) requires 28 − 1 to be divis- ible by 15, and indeed, 255 = 17 × 15.)

66 BREAKING RSA ENCRYPTION
 As an alternative derivation of (3.5), note that since a is divisible neither by p nor by q, it has no factors in common with pq and is thereforeinGpq.ThenumberofelementsofGpq ispq−1−(p− 1)−(q−1)=(p−1)(q−1),sincethereare pq−1integersless than pq , among which are p − 1 multiples of q and another distinct q − 1 multiples of p. Equation (3.5) follows because the order (p − 1)(q − 1) of Gpq must be a multiple of the order of a.
We get the version of (3.5) that is the basis for RSA encryption by taking any integral power s of (3.5) and multiplying both sides by a:
a1+s(q−1)(p−1) ≡ a (mod pq). (3.6)
(The relation (3.6) holds even for integers a that are divisible by p or q . It holds trivially when a is a multiple of p q . And if a is divisible by just one of p and q, let a = kq. Since a is not divisible by p neither is any power of a, and therefore Fermat’s little theorem tells us that [as(q−1)]p−1 =1+np forsomeintegern.Onmultiplyingbothsides byawehavea1+s(q−1)(p−1) ≡a+nap≡a+nkqp,so(3.6)continues to hold.)
Note finally that if c is an integer having no factor in common with (p − 1)(q − 1) then c is in G(p−1)(q−1) and therefore has an inverse in G(p−1)(q−1); i.e. there is a d in G(p−1)(q−1) satisfying
cd ≡1 mod(p−1)(q −1) . So for some integer s ,
c d = 1 + s ( p − 1)(q − 1).
In view of (3.8) and (3.6), any integer a must satisfy

3.3 RSA encryption
Bob wants to receive a message from Alice encoded so that he alone can read it. To do this he picks two large (say 200-digit) prime numbers p and q . He gives Alice, through a public channel, their product N = p q and a large encoding number c that he has picked to have no factors
(3.11)

in common with2 ( p − 1)(q − 1). He does not, however, reveal the separate values of p and q and, given the practical impossibility of factoring a 400-digit number with currently available computers, he is quite confident that neither Alice nor any eavesdropper Eve will be able to calculate p and q knowing only their product N. Bob, however, because he does know p and q , and therefore ( p − 1)(q − 1), can find the multiplicative inverse d of c mod ( p − 1)(q − 1), which satisfies (3.7).3 He keeps d strictly to himself for use in decoding.
Alice encodes a message by representing it as a string of fewer than 400 digits using, for example, some version of ASCII coding. If her message requires more than 400 digits she chops it up into smaller pieces. She interprets each such string as a number a less than N. Using the coding number c and the value of N = pq she received fromBob,shethencalculatesb ≡ ac (mod pq),andsendsitontoBob through a public channel. With c typically a 200-digit number, you might think that this would itself be a huge computational task, but it is not, as noted in Section 3.8. When he receives b, Bob exploits his private knowledge of d to calculate b d (mod p q ), which (3.11) assures him is Alice’s original message a.
Were the eavesdropper Eve able to find the factors p and q of N, she could calculate ( p − 1)(q − 1) and find the decoding integer d from the publicly available coding integer c , the same way Bob did. But factoring a number as large as N is far beyond her classical computational powers. Efficient period finding is of interest in this cryptographic setting not only because it leads directly to efficient factoring (as described in Section 3.10), but also because it can lead Eve directly to an alternative way to decode Alice’s message b without her knowing or having to compute the factors p and q of N. Here is how it works:
Eve uses her efficient period-finding machine to calculate the order r of Alice’s publicly available encoded message b = ac in4 Gpq . Now the order r of Alice’s encoded message b = ac in Gpq is the same
2 As shown in Appendix J, the probability that two large random numbers have no common factor is greater than 12 , so such c are easily found. Whether two numbers do have any factors in common (and what their greatest common factor is) can be determined by a simple algorithm known to Euclid and easily executed by Bob on a classical computer. The Euclidean algorithm is described in Appendix J.
3 This can easily be done classically as a straightforward embellishment of the Euclidean algorithm. See Appendix J.
4 I assume that Alice’s unencoded message a, and hence her coded message b, isinGpq –i.e.thata isnotamultipleof p orq.Since p andq arehuge prime numbers, the odds against a being such a multiple are astronomical. But if Eve wants to be insanely careful she can find the greatest common factor of b and N, using the Euclidean algorithm. In the grossly improbable case that it turns out not to be 1, Eve will have factored N and can decode Alice’s message the same way Bob does.
3.3 RSA ENCRYPTION 67

 as the order of a. This is because the subgroup of Gpq generated by a contains ac = b, and hence it contains the subgroup generated by b; but the subgroup generated by b contains bd = a, and hence the subgroup generated by a. Since each subgroup contains the other, they must be identical. Since the order of a or b is the number of elements in the subgroup it generates, their orders are the same. So if Eve can find the order r of Alice’s code message b, then she has also learned the order of Alice’s original text a.
Since Bob has picked c to have no factors in common with
(p−1)(q −1),andsincer dividestheorder(p−1)(q −1)ofGpq,

Eve has thus used her ability to find periods to decode Alice’s encoded message b = ac to reveal Alice’s original message a.
This use of period finding to defeat RSA encryption is summarized in Table 3.1.
3.4 Quantum period finding: preliminary remarks
So we can crack the RSA code if we have a fast way to find the period r of the known periodic function
f(x)=bx (modN). (3.14)
This might appear to be a simple task, especially since periodic func- tions of the special form (3.14) have the simplifying feature that f(x+s)= f(x)onlyifsisamultipleoftheperiodr.Butbx(modN) is precisely the kind of function whose values within a period hop about so irregularly as to offer no obvious clues about the period. One could try evaluating f (x) for random x until one found two different values of x for which f agreed. Those values would differ by a multiple of the period, which would provide some important information about the value of the period itself. But this is an inefficient way to proceed,
even classically.

       Let n0 be the number of bits in N = pq, so that 2n0 is the smallest power of 2 that exceeds N. If N is a 500-digit number – a typical size for cryptographic applications – n0 will be around 1700. This also sets the scale for the typical number of bits in the other relevant numbers a , b , and their modulo- N period r . To have an appreciable probability of finding r by random searching requires a number of evaluations of
f that is exponential in n0 (just as in the classical approach to Simon’s problem, described in Chapter 2). There are classical ways to improve on random searching, using, for example, Fourier analysis, but no clas- sical approach is known that does not require a time that grows faster than any power of n0. With a quantum computer, however, quantum parallelism gets us tantalizingly close (but, as in Simon’s problem, not close enough) to solving the problem with a single application of U f , and enables us to solve it completely with probability arbitrarily close to unity in a time that grows only as a low-order polynomial in n0.
Todealwithvaluesofxand f(x)=bx (modN)between0andN, both the input and output registers must contain at least n0 Qbits. For reasons that will emerge in Section 3.7, however, to find the period r efficiently the input register must actually have n = 2n0 Qbits. Dou- bling the number of Qbits in the input register ensures that the range of values of x for which f (x) is calculated contains at least N full periods of f . This redundancy turns out to be essential for a successful deter- mination of the period by Shor’s method. (We shall see in Section 3.7 thatif p andq bothhappentobeprimesoftheform2j +1then–and only then – the method works without doubling the size of the input register. Thus N = 15 = (2 + 1)(22 + 1) does not provide a realistic

 test case for laboratory attempts to demonstrate Shor’s algorithm for small p and q with real Qbits.)
We begin the quantum period-finding algorithm by using our quan- tum computer in the familiar way to construct the state

|x⟩n|f(x)⟩n0 (3.15) x=0
with a single application of U f . In Section 3.8 we take a closer look at how this might efficiently be done in the case of interest, f(x) = bx (mod N). Once the state of the registers has become (3.15), we can measure the n-Qbit output register.5 If the measurement yields the value f0, then the generalized Born rule tells us that the state of the n-Qbit input register can be taken to be

depending on the value of x0 (where [x] is the integral part of x – the largest integer less than or equal to x). As in the examples of Chapter 2, if we could produce a small number of identical copies of the state (3.16) the job would be done, for a measurement in the computational basis would yield a random one of the values x0 + kr , and the difference between the results of pairs of measurements on such identical copies would give us a collection of random multiples of r from which r itself could straightforwardly be extracted. But this possibility is ruled out by the no-cloning theorem. All we can extract is a single value of x0 + kr for unknown random x0, which is useless for determining r. And, of course, if we ran the whole algorithm again, we would end up with a state of the form (3.16) for another random value of x0, which would permit no useful comparison with what we had learned from the first run.
But, as with Simon’s problem, we can do something more clever to the state (3.16) before making our final measurement. The problem is the displacement by the unknown random x0, which prevents any information about r from being extracted in a single measurement. We need a unitary transformation that transforms the x0 dependence into
5 It is not, in fact, necessary to measure the output register. One can continue to work with the full state (3.15) in which one breaks down the sum on x into a sum over all the different values of f and a sum over all the values of x associated with each value of f . The only purpose of the measurement is to clarify the analysis by eliminating a lot of uninteresting additional structure, coming from the sum on the values of f , that plays no role beyond making many of the subsequent expressions somewhat lengthier.

3.5 The quantum Fourier transform
The heart of Shor’s algorithm is a superfast quantum Fourier trans- form, which can be carried out by a spectacularly efficient quantum circuit built entirely out of 1-Qbit and 2-Qbit gates. The n-Qbit quan- tum Fourier transform is defined to be that unitary transformation UFT whose action on the computational basis is given by
2n −1
y=0
The product x y is here ordinary multiplication.6 One easily verifies that
UFT|x⟩ is normalized to unity and that UFT|x⟩ is orthogonal to UFT|x′⟩
unless x = x′, so UFT is unitary. Unitarity also emerges directly from
the analysis that follows, which explicitly constructs UFT out of 1- and
2-Qbit unitary gates. The unitary UFT is useful because, as one also
easily verifies, applied to a superposition of states |x⟩ with complex
amplitudes γ(x), it produces another superposition with amplitudes
that are related to γ (x) by the appropriate discrete Fourier transform: 

The celebrated classical fast Fourier transform is an algorithm re- quiring a time that grows with the number of bits as n2n (rather than 2n 2 as the obvious direct approach would require) to evaluate γ ̃ . But there is a quantum algorithm for executing the unitary transformation UFT exponentially faster than fast, in a time that grows only as n2. The catch, as usual, is that one does not end up knowing the complete
6 A warning to physicists (which others can ignore). This looks deceptively like a (discretized) transformation from a position to a momentum representation, and one’s first reaction might be that it is (perhaps disappointingly) familiar. But it has, in fact, an entirely different character. The number x is the integer represented by the state |x⟩; it is not the position of anything. Changing x to x + 1 induces an arithmetically natural but physically quite unnatural transformation on the computational-basis states, determined by the laws of binary addition, including carrying. It bears no resemblance to anything that could be associated with a spatial translation in the physical space of Qbits. So your eyes should not glaze over, and you should regard UFT as a new and unfamiliar physical transformation of Qbits.

 set of Fourier coefficients, as one does after applying the classical fast Fourier transform. One just has n Qbits described by the state given by the right side of (3.19), and as we have repeatedly noted, having a collection of Qbits in a given state does not enable one to learn what that state actually is. There is no way to extract all the Fourier coefficients γ ̃, given an n-Qbit register in the state (3.19). But if γ is a periodic function with a period that is no bigger than 2n/2, then a register in the state (3.19) can give powerful clues about the precise value of the period r , even though r can be hundreds of digits long.
Notice the resemblance of the quantum Fourier transform (3.18) to the n-fold Hadamard transformation. Since −1 = eπi, the n-fold Hadamard (2.30) assumes the form
1 2n−1
2n /2
y=0
Aside from the different powers of 2 appearing in the quantum Fourier transform (3.18) – so the factors of modulus 1 in the superposition are not just 1 and −1 – the only other difference between the two transforms is that x y is ordinary multiplication in the quantum Fourier transform, whereas x · y is the bitwise inner product in the n-fold Hadamard. Because the arithmetic product xy is a more elaborate function of x and y than x · y, the quantum Fourier transformation cannot be built entirely out of 1-Qbit unitary gates as the n-fold Hadamard is. But, remarkably, it can be constructed entirely out of 1- and 2-Qbit gates. Even more remarkably, when the procedure is used for period finding all of the 2-Qbit gates can be replaced by 1-Qbit measurement gates followed by additional 1-Qbit unitary gates whose application is contingent on the measurement outcomes.
To construct a circuit to execute the quantum Fourier transform UFT, it is convenient to introduce an n-Qbit unitary operator Z, diag- onal in the computational basis:
Z|y⟩n = e2πiy/2n |y⟩n. (3.22) This can be viewed as a generalization to n Qbits of the 1-Qbit operator
H⊗n|x⟩n =
eπix·y|y⟩n. (3.21)
Z, to which it reduces when n = 1. Using the familiar relation

3.5 THE QUANTUM FOURIER TRANSFORM 73
 |x⟩n are a basis, this will give us an alternative expression for UFT itself. The construction of this alternative form for (3.24) is made more transparent by specializing to the case of four Qbits. The structure that emerges in the case n = 4 has an obvious extension to general n. Dealing with the case of general n from the start only obscures things.
When n = 4 we want to find an appropriate form for
UFT|x3⟩|x2⟩|x1⟩|x0⟩ = ZxH3H2H1H0|0⟩|0⟩|0⟩|0⟩. (3.25)
As usual, we number the Qbits by the power of 2 with which they are associated, with the least significant on the right, so that, reading from right to left, the Qbits are labeled 0, 1, 2, and 3; Hi acts on the Qbit labeled i (and as the identity on all other Qbits). If |y⟩4 = |y3⟩|y2⟩|y1⟩|y0⟩ in the definition (3.22) of Z, so that y = 8y3 + 4y2 + 2y1 + y0, then the operator Z can be constructed out of single-Qbit number operators:

iπ
Z =exp 8 8n3 +4n2 +2n1 +n0 . (3.26)
The operator Zx appearing in (3.25) then becomes

x iπ
Z =exp 8 8x3 +4x2 +2x1 +x0 8n3 +4n2 +2n1 +n0 .
(3.27) Because the 1-Qbit operator exp(2π i n) acts as the identity on either of the 1-Qbit states |0⟩ and |1⟩, and because any 1-Qbit state is a
superposition of these two, n obeys the operator identity
exp(2πin) = 1. (3.28)
Therefore, in multiplying out the two terms
8x3 +4x2 +2x1 +x0 8n3 +4n2 +2n1 +n0 (3.29)
appearing in the exponential (3.27), we can drop all products xinj whose coefficients are a power of 2 greater than 8, getting

+(x3 + 12x2 + 14x1 + 18x0)n0 . (3.30) Note next that the number and Hadamard operators for any single
Qbit obey the relation
exp(iπxn)H|0⟩ = H|x⟩. (3.31)
This is trivial when x = 0, and when x = 1 it reduces to the correct statement

We have used the fact that number operators associated with different Qbits commute with one another. Note also that because the number operator ni is multiplied by x3−i on the left side of (3.33), the state of the Qbit labeled i on the right is |x3−i ⟩.

If we did not have to worry about Hadamard operators interposing themselves be- tween number operators and their eigenstates, we could replace each xi in (3.35) by the number operator n3−i of which it is the eigenvalue to get

If we define 2-Qbit unitary operators by

 then (3.36) assumes the more readable form UFT|x3⟩|x2⟩|x1⟩|x0⟩
= H3 V32H2 V31V21H1 V30V20V10H0 |x0⟩|x1⟩|x2⟩|x3⟩. (3.38)
I have put in unnecessary parentheses to guide the eye to the simple structure, whose generalization to more than four Qbits is, as promised, obvious.
If we define the unitary operator P to bring about the permutation of computational basis states
P|x3⟩|x2⟩|x1⟩|x0⟩ = |x0⟩|x1⟩|x2⟩|x3⟩, (3.39) then (3.38) becomes

= H3 V32H2 V31V21H1 V30V20V10H0 P|x3⟩|x2⟩|x1⟩|x0⟩. (3.40)
Since (3.40) holds for all computational-basis states it holds for arbi- trary states and is therefore equivalent to the operator identity
UFT = H3(V32H2)(V31V21H1)(V30V20V10H0)P. (3.41)
The form (3.41) expresses UFT as a product of unitary operators, thereby independently establishing what we have already noted directly from its definition, that UFT is unitary. More importantly it gives an explicit construction of UFT entirely out of one- and two-Qbit unitary gates, whose number grows only quadratically with the number n of Qbits. (The permutation P can be constructed out of cNOT gates and one additional Qbit, initially in the state |0⟩ – an instructive exercise to think about – but in the application that follows it is much easier to build directly into the circuitry the rearranging of Qbits accomplished by P.)
The permutation operator P plays an important role in establishing that the circuit (3.41) that produces the quantum Fourier transform
†
UFT has an inverse U possessing the structure one expects for an FT
inverse Fourier transform. Since the adjoint of a product is the product of the adjoints in the opposite order, and since Hadamards and P are self-adjoint, we have from (3.41)
One can insert 1 = PP on the extreme right of (3.42) and then note that the effect of sandwiching all the Hadamards and 1-Qbit unitaries between two Ps is simply to alter all their indices by the permutation taking 0123 → 3210. Therefore

Finally, if we note from (3.37) that each V is symmetric in its indices, and rearrange the parentheses in (3.44) to make easier the comparison with the form (3.41) of UFT, we have
This is precisely the form (3.41) of UFT itself, except that each V is replaced by its adjoint, which (3.37) shows amounts to replacing each i by −i in the arguments of all the phase factors. This is exactly what one does to invert the ordinary functional Fourier transform.

3.6 ELIMINATING THE 2-QBIT GATES 77
                           Since the action (3.37) of the controlled-V gates is symmetric in i and j , Figure 3.1 can be redrawn with control and target Qbits interchanged.
Fig 3.2
 on the left, P, permutes the states of the Qbits, exchanging the states of the most and least significant Qbits, the states of the next most signifi- cant and next least significant Qbits, etc. Rather than introducing such a permutation gate, it makes more sense simply to reverse the conven- tion for the input state, associating Qbits that represent more significant bits with lower lines in the figure. The gate P is then omitted, and the conventional ordering of significant bits is reversed for the input. The complete figure thus reduces to the portion to the right of the per- mutation gate P. For the output, of course, the conventional ordering remains in effect: Qbits on higher lines represent more significant bits.
If the input on the left of the complete Figure 3.1 or 3.2 (with the gate P) is the computational-basis state |x⟩4 = |x3⟩|x2⟩|x1⟩|x0⟩ the output on the right will be UFT|x⟩4, the superposition (3.18) of computational- basis states |y⟩4 = |y3⟩|y2⟩|y1⟩|y0⟩, defined in (3.18).
There is no need for the figures to have subscripts on the Hadamard gates appearing in (3.40), since each is explicitly attached to the line associated with the Qbit on which it acts. For the same reason each 2-Qbit controlled-V gate requires only a single subscript, which spec- ifies the unitary operator Vk that acts on the target Qbit when the computational-basis state of the control Qbit is |1⟩; the subscript k is the number of “wires” the target Qbit is away from the control Qbit. The explicit form of Vk is e i π n/2k , where n is the number operator for the target Qbit.
Figure 3.2 reveals a further simplification of great practical inter- est, if all the Qbits are measured as soon as the action of the quantum Fourier transformation is completed. This simplification, pointed out by Griffiths and Niu, allows the 2-Qbit controlled-V gates to be re- placed by 1-Qbit gates that act or not, depending on the outcome of a prior measurement of the control Qbit, as shown in Figure 3.3. The simplification is made possible by the following general fact.
If a controlled operation CU, or a series of consecutive controlled operations all with the same control Qbit, is immediately followed by

  If the Qbits are all measured immediately after all the gates of the quantum Fourier transform have acted, then the 1-Qbit measurement gates can be applied to each Qbit immediately after the action of the Hadamard gate on that Qbit, and the controlled-V gates that follow the action of the Hadamards in Figure 3.2 can be replaced by 1-Qbit gates that act or not depending on whether the outcome y of the 1-Qbit measurement is 1 or 0.
  a measurement of the control Qbit, then the possible final states of all the Qbits and the probabilities of those states are exactly the same as they would be if the measurement of the control Qbit took place before the application of the controlled operation, and then the target Qbit(s) were acted upon or not by U, depending on whether the result of the prior measurement was 0 or 1. To confirm this, write an n-Qbit state as
|⟩n = α0|0⟩1|0⟩n−1 + α1|1⟩1|1⟩n−1, (3.46)
where the state of the control Qbit is on the left, the states |i ⟩ are unit vectors, and the unitary operation U acts on some or all of the remaining n − 1 Qbits. Applying the controlled-U operation CU to n gives
CU|⟩n = α0|0⟩1|0⟩n−1 + α1|1⟩1U|1⟩n−1. (3.47) If this is immediately followed by a measurement of the control Qbit,
the post-measurement states and associated probabilities are
|0⟩|0⟩, p = |α0|2; |1⟩U|1⟩, p = |α1|2, (3.48)
according to the generalized Born rule. On the other hand if we measure the control Qbit before applying the controlled-U, the resulting states and associated probabilities are
|0⟩|0⟩, p = |α0|2; |1⟩|1⟩, p = |α1|2, (3.49)
so if we then apply U to the remaining n − 1 Qbits if and only if the result of the earlier measurement was 1, we end up with exactly the same states and probabilities as in (3.48).
We shall see that if one’s aim is to find the period of the function f , one can indeed measure each Qbit immediately after applying the

quantum Fourier transform. So this replacement of controlled uni- tary gates by 1-Qbit unitary gates, which act or not depending on the outcome of the measurement, is of great importance from the tech- nological point of view, 1-Qbit unitaries being far easier to implement than 2-Qbit controlled gates.
To see how the general procedure works in this particular case, consider first the bottom wire in Figure 3.2. Once H and the three controlled-V gates have acted on it, nothing further happens to that Qbit until its final measurement. If the result of that measurement is 1, the state of all four Qbits reduces to that component of the full superposition in which V1, V2, and V3 have acted on the three wires above the bottom wire; if the result of the measurement is 0, the 4-Qbit state reduces to the component in which they have not acted. We can produce exactly the same effect if we measure the least signif- icant output Qbit immediately after H has acted on the bottom wire, before any of the other gates have acted, and then apply or do not apply the three unitary transformations to the other three Qbits, depending on whether the outcome of the measurement is 1 or 0. Next, we apply the Hadamard transformation to the second wire from the bottom. We then immediately measure that Qbit and, depending on the outcome, apply or do not apply the appropriate 1-Qbit unitary transformations to each of the remaining two Qbits. Continuing in this way, we end up producing exactly the same statistical distribution of measurement re- sults as we would have produced had we used the 2-Qbit controlled-V gates, measuring none of the Qbits until the full unitary transformation UFT had been produced. Thus Figure 3.2, followed by measurements of all four Qbits on the right yielding the values y3, y2, y1, and y0, is equivalent to Figure 3.3.
The most attractive (but least common) way of representing the quantum Fourier transform with a circuit diagram is shown in Figure 3.4.7 In this form the inversion in order from most to least significant Qbits between the input and the output is shown by bending the Qbit lines, rather than by inverting the order in the state symbols. The 2- Qbit gates V are also displayed in a symmetric way that does not suggest an artificial distinction between control and target Qbits.
3.7 Finding the period
The period r of f appears in the state (3.16) of the input-register Qbits produced from a single application of U f . To get valuable information
7 The figure is based on one drawn by Robert B. Griffiths and Chi-Sheng Niu in their paper setting forth the Griffiths–Niu trick, “Semiclassical Fourier transform for quantum computation,” Physical Review Letters 76, 3228–3231 (1996) (http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9511007).

  A more symmetric way of drawing Figure 3.1
or 3.2, due to Griffiths and Niu. Although it is superior to the conventional diagram, it does not seem to have caught on. The permutation P that in effect permutes the Qbits in the input register is now built into the diagram by using lines that no longer connect input-register Qbits to output-register Qbits at the same horizontal level. Because the lines now cross one another, the unitary operators V can be represented by the circles at the intersections of the lines associated with the Qbits that they couple, eliminating the artificial distinction between control and target Qbits used in Figures 3.1 and 3.2. The form of each such operator isV=expiπnn′/2k ,

The larger the phase produced by V, the blacker the circle.

If we now make a measurement, the probability p(y) of getting the result y is just the squared magnitude of the coefficient of |y⟩ in (3.50). The factor e 2π i x0 y/2n , in which the formerly troublesome x0 explicitly occurs, drops out of this probability8 and we are left with
k=0
This completes the quantum-computational part of the process, except that, as noted below, we may have to repeat the procedure a small number of times (of order ten or so) to achieve a high probability of learning the period r . To see why the form (3.51) of p(y) makes this possible, we require some further purely mathematical analysis, that at a certain point will exploit yet another branch of elementary number theory.
The probability (3.51) is a simple explicit function of the integer y, whose magnitude has maxima when y is close9 to integral multiples of

 2n /r . In fact we now show that the probability is at least 0.4 that the measured value of y will be as close as possible to – i.e. within 12 of – an integral multiple of 2n /r . To see this we calculate a lower bound for
p(y) when
y=yj =j2n/r+δj, (3.52)
with |δ j | ≤ 12 . Only the term in δ j contributes to the exponentials in (3.51). The summation is a geometric series, which can be explicitly summed to give
p(yj) = 1 sin2(πδjmr/2n). (3.53) 2nm sin2(πδjr/2n)
Since (3.17) tells us that m is within an integer of 2n /r , and since 2n/r ≥ N2/r > N, we can with negligible error replace mr/2n by 1 in the numerator of (3.53), and replace the sine in the denominator by its (extremely small) argument. This gives

Since δ j ≤ 12 the probability (3.54) is bounded below by p(yj ) ≥ (4/π2)/r.

(3.56)
Since there are at least r − 1 different values of j , and since r is a large number,10 one has at least a 40% chance (4/π2 = 0.4053) of getting one of the special values (3.52) for y – a value that is within 12 of an integral multiple of 2n /r .
Note, in passing, that as δj → 0 in (3.54) the probability p(yj ) becomes 1/r, so that if all the δj are 0 – i.e. if the period r is exactly a power of 2 – then the probability of measuring an integral multiple of 2n /r is essentially 1. Indeed, you can easily check that in this (highly unlikely) case the probability remains 1 even if we do not double the number of Qbits in the input register and take n = n0. Thus the case r = 2j avoids some of the major complications of quantum period
required here is different in two important ways. Because we need to know the enormous integer r exactly we must pay much more careful attention to just how much of the probability is concentrated in those special values of y, and we must also solve the subtle problem of how to get from such maximum values to the precise period r itself.
10 One can easily test with a classical computer all values of r less than, say, 100, to see whether they are periods of f ; one need resort to the quantum computation only if r itself is enormous.

 finding. Since r divides ( p − 1)(q − 1), all periods modulo p q must be powers of 2 if p and q are both primes of the form 2n + 1. The smallest such primes are 3, 5, 17, and 257. Hence claims to have realized the Shor algorithm for factoring 15 are to be taken cum grano salis, as should possible future claims based on factoring 51, 85, and 771.
Note also that the derivation of (3.56) requires only that the argu- ment of the sine in the denominator of (3.53) be small. This will be the case if 2n is any large multiple of N – i.e. if the input register is large enough to contain many periods of b x (mod N). The stronger require- ment that 2n should be as large as N2 – that the input register should actually be able to accomodate at least N full periods – emerges when we examine whether it is possible to learn r itself, given an integral multiple of 2n /r .
Suppose that we have found a y that is within 12 of j 2n /r for some integer j . It follows that

Since y is the result of our measurement and we know n, the number of input-register Qbits, we have an estimate for the fraction j/r. It is here that our use of an n-Qbit input register with 2n > N2 is crucial. By using twice as many Qbits as needed to represent all the integers up to N, we have ensured that our estimate (3.57) of j/r is off by no more than 1/(2N2). But since r < N, and since any two distinct fractions with denominators less than N must differ11 by at least 1/N2, the measured value of y and the fact that r is less than N is enough to determine a unique value of the rational number j/r.
That value of j/r can be efficiently extracted from the known value of y/2n by an application of the theory of continued fractions. This exploits the theorem that if x is an estimate for j/r that differs from it by less than 1/(2r 2), then j/r will appear as one of the partial sums in the continued-fraction expansion of x. The application of the theorem in this context is illustrated in Appendix K. The continued-fraction expansion of y/2n gives us not j and r separately, but the fraction j/r reduced to lowest terms – i.e. it gives us integers j0 and r0 with no common factors that satisfy j0/r0 = j/r. The r0 we learn is thus a divisor of r .
Since r is r0 times the factors j has in common with r , if we were luckyenoughtogeta j thatiscoprimetor,thenr0 = r.Since,asshown in Appendix J, two random numbers j and r have a better than even chance of having no common factors, we do not have to be terribly lucky.

3.8 CALCULATING THE PERIODIC FUNCTION 83
 We can easily check to see whether r 0 itself is the period r by computing (withaclassicalcomputer)br0 (modN)andseeingwhetherornotitis b. If it is not, we can try several low multiples, 2r0, 3r0, 4r0, . . ., since it is unlikely that j will share a large factor with r .
If this fails, we can repeat the entire quantum computation from the beginning. We now get j′/r, where j′ is another (random) integer,

If j and j have no factors in common – which has a better than even chance of happening – then r will be the least commonmultiple12 ofitstwodivisorsr0 andr0′.Wecanagaintesttosee whether we have the right r by evaluating br (mod N) to see whether it is indeed equal to b. If it is not, we can again try some of the lower multiples of our candidate for r and, if necessary, go through the whole business one more time to get yet another random multiple of 1/r .
Because we are not certain that our measurement gives us one of the yj andthusadivisorofr,wemayhavetorepeatthewholeprocedure several (but not a great many) times before succeeding, carrying out some not terribly taxing mathematical detective work, with the aid of a classical computer, to find the period r . The detective work is greatly simplified by the fact (established in Appendix L) that when N is the product of two primes, the period r is not only less than N, but also less than 12 N. As a result, a more extended analysis shows that the probability of learning a divisor of r from the measured value of y is bounded from below not just by 0.4, but by more than 0.9. Furthermore, by adding just a small number q of additional Qbits to the input register, so that n exceeds 2n 0 + q , the probability of learning a divisor of r in a single run can be made quite close to 1. These refinements are described in Appendix L.
3.8 Calculating the periodic function
We have assumed the existence of an efficient subroutine that calcu-
lates b x (mod N). You might think that calculating f (x) = b x (mod
N) for arbitrary values of x less than, say, 2n = 10800 would require
astronomical numbers of multiplications, but it does not. We simply
square b (mod N), square the result (mod N), square that, etc., cal-

 (a) (b)
At the end of this process we will still have x in the input register (which serves only as a set of control bits for the n controlled multiplications), and we will have b x (mod N) in the output register. The work register will contain b2n whatever the value of x in the input register, and it will therefore be unentangled with the input and output registers and can be ignored when we take our starting point to be a superposition of classical inputs.13
Note the striking difference between classical and quantum pro- gramming styles. One’s classical computational instincts would direct one to make a look-up table of all n modulo-N multiple squares of b, since (a) Cbits are cheap and stable and (b) otherwise to get b x (mod N) for all the needed values of x one would have to recalculate the successive squares so many times that this would become ridiculously inefficient. But the situation is quite the opposite with a quantum computer, since (a) Qbits are expensive and fragile and (b) “quantum parallelism” makes it possible to produce the state (3.15) with only a single execution of the procedure that does the successive squarings, thereby relieving us of any need to store all the modulo-N squares, at a substantial saving in Qbits.
As usual with quantum parallelism, there is the major catch that an immediate measurement of Qbits in the state (3.15) can reveal only the value of a single (random) one of the modulo-N powers of b. But by applying UFT to the input register of the state (3.15) and only then making the measurement, we can get important collective information about the modulo-N values of bx – in this case a divisor of the crucial period r – at the (unimportant) price of losing all information about the individual values of b x .

 gates would allow two Qbits to interact in a carefully controlled way for an interval of time that was specified very precisely, but obviously not to hundreds of significant figures. It is therefore crucial that the effectiveness of the period-finding algorithm not be greatly affected by small errors in the phase shifts.
On the face of it this seems worrisome. Since we need to know the period r to hundreds of digits, don’t we have to get the phase shifts right to a comparable precision? Here the fundamentally digital character of the actual output of a quantum computation saves the day. To learn r we require the outcomes of several hundreds of 1-Qbit measurements, each of which has just two possible outcomes (0 or 1). The action of the unitary gates that precede the measurements is like that of an analog computer, involving continuously variable phase shifts that cannot be controlled with perfect precision. But this analog evolution affects only the probabilities of the sharply defined digital outputs. Small alterations in the phases produce small alterations in the probabilities of getting that extremely precise digital information, but not the precision of the information itself, once it is acquired.14
Suppose that the phase of each term in the quantum Fourier trans- form (3.18) is incorrect by an amount φ(x, y), and that each of these altered phases is bounded in magnitude by φ ≪ 1. The probability

The number n of Qbits in the input register might be as large as 3000 for problems of interest (factoring a 500-digit N). Consequently for all practical purposes one can omit from the quantum Fourier transform all controlled-phase gates connecting Qbits that are more than about l = 22 wires apart in the circuit diagram. This has two major advan- tages. Of crucial importance, quantum engineers will not have to pro- duce impossibly precise phase changes. Furthermore, the size of the cir- cuit executing the quantum Fourier transform has to grow only linearly with large n rather than quadratically. Since n is likely to be of order 103 for practical code breaking, this too is a significant improvement.
3.10 Period finding and factoring
Since Shor’s period-finding quantum algorithm is always described as a factoring algorithm, we conclude this chapter by noting how period finding leads to factoring. We consider only the case relevant to RSA encryption, where one wants to factor the product of two large primes, N = pq,althoughtheconnectionbetweenperiodfindingandfactoring is more general.
If we have a way to determine periods (such as Shor’s algorithm) and want to find the large prime factors of N = pq , we pick a random

with |i − j | > l, the maximum phase error φ this can produce in any term is φ = nπ/2l, and therefore the probability will be within 1% of its ideal value if 1/2l < 1/(500nπ).

 number a coprime to N. The odds that a random a happens to be a multiple of p or of q are minuscule when p and q are enormous, but if you are the worrying kind you can check that it isn’t, using the Euclidean algorithm. (In the overwhelmingly unlikely event that a is a multiple of p or q then the Euclidean algorithm applied to a and N will give you p or q directly, and you will have factored N.) Using our period-finding routine, we find the order of a in G p q : the smallest r for which
ar ≡1(modpq). (3.64)
We can use this information to factor N if our choice of a was lucky in two ways.
Suppose first that we are fortunate enough to get an r that is even. We can then calculate
and note that
x = ar/2 (mod pq) (3.65) 0≡x2−1≡(x−1)(x+1) (modpq). (3.66)
Now x − 1 = ar/2 − 1 is not congruent to 0 modulo pq , since r is the smallest power of a congruent to 1. Suppose in addition – our second piece of good fortune – that
x + 1 = ar/2 + 1 ̸≡ 0 (mod pq). (3.67)
Inthatcaseneitherx−1norx+1isdivisiblebyN= pq,but(3.66) tells us that their product is. Since p and q are prime this is possible onlyifoneofthem,say p,dividesx−1andtheother,q,divides x + 1. Because the only divisors of N are p and q, it follows that p is the greatest common divisor of N and x − 1, while q is the greatest common divisor of N and x +1. We can therefore find p or q by a straightforward application of the Euclidean algorithm.
So it all comes down to the likelihood of our being lucky. We show in Appendix M that the probability is at least 0.5 that a random number ainGpq hasanorderrthatisevenwithar/2̸≡−1(modpq).Sowe do not have to repeat the procedure an enormous number of times to achieve a very high probability of success. If you’re willing to accept the fact that you don’t have to try out very many random numbers a in order to succeed, then this elementary argument is all you need to know about why period finding enables you to factor N = pq. But if you’re curious about why the probability of good fortune is so high, then you must contend with Appendix M, where I have constructed an elementary but rather elaborate argument, by condensing a fairly large body of number-theoretic lore into the comparatively simple form it assumes when applied to the special case in which the number N is the product of two primes.

Section 3.1 of Chapter 3, titled "Period finding, factoring, and cryptography," delves into the intricacies of how quantum computing intersects with the realms of cryptography and number theory. The section underscores the pivotal role of period finding in quantum computing, particularly in the context of solving problems that classical computers find intractable within a reasonable timeframe.

Period finding, in quantum computing, involves determining the periodicity of a function—a task that classical algorithms struggle with, especially as the input size grows. This capability has profound implications for cryptography, especially for systems that rely on the difficulty of factoring large prime numbers, such as RSA encryption.

RSA encryption, a cornerstone of modern secure communication, hinges on the computational difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Classical computing's inability to efficiently factor such products is what underpins the security of RSA-encrypted messages. However, the advent of quantum computing, particularly algorithms capable of period finding, challenges this security paradigm.

Simon's problem is introduced as a simpler analog, setting the stage for understanding Shor's algorithm—a quantum algorithm that demonstrates quantum computing's potential to efficiently solve period-finding problems. Shor's algorithm leverages quantum mechanics to find the period of a function with exponential speedup over classical methods.

The significance of period finding extends beyond theoretical interest; it directly impacts the practical security of cryptographic systems. If a quantum computer can efficiently find the period of certain functions related to the encryption scheme, it can also factor the large numbers upon which the security of RSA encryption relies. This ability would render many current cryptographic practices vulnerable, necessitating a reevaluation of security strategies in a post-quantum world.

This section serves as both an introduction to the quantum computational approach to period finding and a bridge to understanding its implications for cryptography. It sets the stage for a deeper exploration of quantum algorithms, like Shor's, that can exploit this quantum advantage for practical applications, including breaking widely used encryption systems.

Section 3.2, titled "Number-theoretic preliminaries," lays the foundational mathematical concepts necessary to grasp the workings of RSA encryption. It begins by introducing the concept of modulo-N arithmetic, which is central to understanding how numbers can be manipulated within the finite sets that underpin cryptographic systems. In modulo-N arithmetic, numbers wrap around after reaching N, such that arithmetic operations are performed with respect to a fixed modulus N, ensuring all results fall within a predefined set of numbers from 0 to N-1.

The section further explores the concept of finite groups, particularly focusing on the group GN, which consists of all positive integers less than N that are coprime to N (i.e., they share no common factors with N other than 1). This group is crucial because it forms the basis of operations within RSA encryption, where the security of the encryption relies on the difficulty of solving problems within such a group structure.

Another key concept introduced is the idea of multiplication modulo N. The section explains how this operation preserves the group structure of GN, allowing for the definition of multiplicative inverses within the group. This property is pivotal for RSA encryption, as it enables the decryption process, where finding the multiplicative inverse of the encryption key (under modulo N) allows for the recovery of the original message.

Fermat's little theorem is also discussed, which states that for any integer a not divisible by a prime p, the number a^(p-1) is congruent to 1 modulo p. This theorem is instrumental in understanding the encryption and decryption process of RSA, as it provides a mathematical guarantee that certain operations will "undo" themselves under the right conditions, thereby allowing a message to be securely encrypted and then decrypted.

Finally, the section delves into the RSA encryption mechanism itself, explaining how these number-theoretic concepts are applied to create a secure communication channel. RSA encryption exploits the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime components, a task that is computationally feasible using classical algorithms only for small numbers. By combining the properties of modulo-N arithmetic, the structure of finite groups, and the implications of Fermat's little theorem, RSA encryption secures data against unauthorized access, relying on the infeasibility of certain mathematical operations for its security.

In sum, Section 3.2 provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the number-theoretic underpinnings of RSA encryption, highlighting the importance of modulo-N arithmetic, the structure and properties of finite groups, and the critical role of Fermat's little theorem in ensuring the viability and security of this widely used cryptographic system.

Section 3.3, titled "RSA encryption," dives into the mechanics of the RSA encryption method, a cornerstone of modern digital security. It outlines the process by which RSA encryption enables secure communication between two parties, typically referred to as Alice and Bob, and even protects against eavesdropping by third parties, such as Eve.

The RSA method starts with Bob selecting two large prime numbers, denoted as $p$ and $q$. These primes are used to compute $N = pq$, which forms part of the public key. The beauty and security of RSA lie in the difficulty of factoring $N$ back into its prime constituents with current computing technology, especially as $p$ and $q$ grow larger, reaching hundreds of digits.

Bob then chooses a large number $c$, which, alongside $N$, is publicly shared as his encryption key. The number $c$ is chosen to be coprime to $(p-1)(q-1)$, ensuring it has a multiplicative inverse modulo $(p-1)(q-1)$. This inverse, denoted as $d$, acts as Bob's private key for decryption. The computation of $d$ from $c$ is straightforward for Bob, given his knowledge of $p$ and $q$, but it is practically impossible for anyone else without this information.

Alice, wishing to send a secure message to Bob, represents her message as a number $a$ smaller than $N$. She then uses Bob's public key to encrypt her message, computing $b \equiv a^c \mod N$, and sends $b$ to Bob. Upon receiving $b$, Bob applies his private key $d$ to decrypt the message, calculating $a \equiv b^d \mod N$, thereby recovering Alice's original message.

The security of RSA encryption fundamentally relies on the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic, particularly the difficulty of the prime factorization problem. While the public key $c$ and $N$ are shared openly, without the prime factors $p$ and $q$, an unauthorized party cannot feasibly decrypt the message.

This section also explores the mathematical underpinnings of RSA encryption, including the use of Euler's theorem and Fermat's little theorem, to explain why the encryption and decryption process works as intended. It illustrates how RSA leverages mathematical principles to enable secure digital communication, underpinning various applications from secure web browsing to confidential email exchanges.

In essence, Section 3.3 elucidates the RSA encryption algorithm, highlighting the process of key generation, encryption, and decryption, along with the mathematical assurances that underpin the security and practicality of RSA encryption in protecting digital information.

Section 3.4, titled "Quantum period finding: preliminary remarks," introduces the concept of quantum period finding, a critical component in understanding the power of quantum computing, particularly as it relates to Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers—a process with significant implications for cryptography and the security of digital communications.

This section begins by establishing the problem that quantum period finding aims to solve. It explains that finding the period of a function—a task that is computationally demanding for classical computers—can be efficiently handled by a quantum computer. This efficiency stems from a quantum computer's ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, thanks to the principles of superposition and entanglement, core tenets of quantum mechanics.

The text sets the stage for Shor's algorithm by explaining the significance of period finding in the context of factoring large prime numbers. It touches upon the distinction between periodic functions that vary slowly and are thus more amenable to period finding by classical means, and those whose outputs appear random within a period, making their periods difficult to ascertain without quantum computational power.

In discussing the preparatory considerations for quantum period finding, the section elaborates on the role of quantum parallelism. This property allows a quantum computer to evaluate a function at many points simultaneously, a feat that enables the efficient determination of a function's period. However, the narrative makes it clear that while quantum parallelism brings us closer to solving the problem of period finding, it alone is not sufficient. The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is introduced as a crucial component in converting the quantum parallelism's output into a form from which the period can be extracted.

The section concludes by highlighting the broader implications of efficient quantum period finding. If a quantum computer can find periods efficiently, it can factor the products of large primes with similar efficiency. This capability poses a significant threat to the security of encryption methods like RSA, which rely on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers as the basis for their security.

In essence, "Quantum period finding: preliminary remarks" lays the foundational understanding necessary for grasping the quantum computational approach to solving problems that are intractable for classical computers. It emphasizes the transformative potential of quantum computing in fields like cryptography, setting the stage for a more detailed exploration of Shor's algorithm in subsequent sections.

Section 3.5, titled "The quantum Fourier transform," delves into a critical element of quantum computing, particularly as it relates to Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers and finding periods of functions. The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a quantum analogue of the classical discrete Fourier transform, and it plays a pivotal role in quantum algorithms that outperform their classical counterparts.

This section begins by defining the QFT and explaining its significance in the context of quantum computing. The QFT is presented as a unitary operation that, when applied to a quantum state represented in the computational basis, transforms it into a superposition of states in a way that corresponds to the discrete Fourier transform of the amplitudes of the original state. This transformation is crucial for algorithms that require the analysis of periodicity and the extraction of global properties from quantum states, such as Shor's algorithm.

The text outlines the mathematical formulation of the QFT, emphasizing its ability to map between two quantum states in a manner that mirrors the classical Fourier transform's mapping between different representations of a vector. This section may include equations that express how the QFT operates on an input state to produce an output state, highlighting the exponential speedup achieved by leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of quantum mechanics.

Moreover, the section likely explains the implementation of the QFT within a quantum circuit, detailing how it can be constructed using a series of quantum gates that act on the qubits of a quantum computer. This part of the discussion is essential for understanding how the QFT can be practically realized in a quantum algorithm, illustrating the step-by-step process that transforms the input state into the desired output state through controlled rotations and quantum entanglement.

The narrative might also cover the significance of the QFT in the broader context of quantum algorithms, particularly its role in Shor's algorithm for period finding. By applying the QFT, Shor's algorithm is able to efficiently extract the period of a function, a task that is crucial for factoring large numbers and has profound implications for cryptography. The QFT's ability to efficiently process quantum states and reveal hidden periodicities is what enables quantum computers to solve certain problems much more quickly than classical computers.

In summary, "The quantum Fourier transform" section is a technical exploration of one of the most powerful tools in quantum computing. It elucidates how the QFT enables quantum algorithms to perform tasks that would be prohibitively time-consuming on classical computers, thereby providing a foundation for understanding the quantum mechanical processes that underpin algorithms like Shor's.

Section 3.6, titled "Eliminating the 2-Qbit gates," addresses an important aspect of quantum computing: simplifying the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) circuit to make its implementation more practical and feasible. This section focuses on a technique that reduces the complexity of quantum circuits by minimizing the use of 2-Qbit gates, which are more challenging to implement than 1-Qbit gates due to issues like physical qubit connectivity and noise.

The quantum Fourier transform is a crucial component in quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers. The standard implementation of the QFT involves a series of controlled phase rotation gates that act on pairs of qubits, leading to the necessity of 2-Qbit gates. However, these gates can introduce significant implementation challenges, especially as the number of qubits increases, due to the physical constraints of quantum computing hardware and the increased potential for errors.

This section outlines an innovative approach to restructuring the QFT circuit, leveraging the insights from Griffiths and Niu, which allows for the replacement of 2-Qbit controlled-phase gates with operations that can be effectively decomposed into sequences of 1-Qbit gates and classical conditional operations. This method hinges on the observation that if a qubit is measured immediately after its interaction in the QFT circuit, the subsequent operations can be adjusted based on the measurement outcome, thus eliminating the direct need for 2-Qbit interactions.

The text likely explains how this approach utilizes the quantum circuit's inherent properties, where the outcome of measuring a qubit can determine the application of phase shifts on remaining qubits in the circuit. By measuring each qubit right after applying the Hadamard gate and before what would traditionally be a controlled-phase operation, one can conditionally apply phase shifts to subsequent qubits based on the measured values. This strategy significantly simplifies the circuit by reducing the quantum coherence requirements and making the overall procedure more amenable to current quantum computing technologies.

Moreover, this section may detail the practical implications of this simplification, including how it affects the fidelity and scalability of quantum algorithms that rely on the QFT. By reducing the reliance on 2-Qbit gates, this approach potentially lowers the error rates in quantum computations and makes the implementation of algorithms like Shor's more feasible with existing quantum hardware.

In essence, "Eliminating the 2-Qbit gates" presents a critical advancement in quantum circuit design, offering a pathway to more efficient and practical implementations of quantum algorithms by simplifying the quantum Fourier transform circuit. This not only enhances the accessibility of complex quantum operations but also represents a step forward in the ongoing development of quantum computing technology.

Section 3.7, titled "Finding the period," delves into the process of identifying the period of a function using quantum algorithms, a critical step in Shor's algorithm for factoring large prime numbers. This section explains the quantum computational approach to period finding, which is essential for breaking RSA encryption, a common cryptographic scheme that secures online communications.

The period of a function, in this context, refers to the smallest number $r$ such that $f(x) = f(x+r)$ for all $x$. Discovering $r$ efficiently is not feasible with classical algorithms for functions where $r$ is large. However, quantum computing offers a powerful method for uncovering $r$ with significantly less computational effort, exploiting quantum parallelism and the properties of the quantum Fourier transform (QFT).

The section likely begins by outlining the problem setup: given a periodic function $f(x)$ encoded in a quantum circuit, the goal is to find its period $r$. The process involves initializing a quantum system in a superposition of states, applying the function $f$ in a way that entangles the input and output, and then using the QFT to transform the entangled states in a manner that reveals information about $r$.

A key part of the section would explain the role of the QFT in this process. The QFT, applied to the quantum state representing the output of $f(x)$, transforms the superposition in such a way that the resulting quantum state's amplitude distribution encodes information about the period $r$. By measuring this transformed state, one can obtain outcomes that are highly likely to be related to $r$, although indirect.

The text would elaborate on the mathematical details of how the QFT leads to a distribution of outcomes from which $r$ can be deduced. It might cover the concept of constructive and destructive interference patterns generated by the QFT and how these patterns pinpoint the values related to the period $r$.

Furthermore, the section likely discusses the probabilistic nature of the method: while a single measurement post-QFT may not directly yield $r$, repeated applications and measurements can produce a set of outcomes from which $r$ can be accurately inferred. The process involves classical post-processing, including the use of continued fractions or other number-theoretic methods to extract $r$ from the measurement results.

In essence, "Finding the period" outlines a quantum algorithmic technique that leverages the unique capabilities of quantum mechanics to solve a problem of practical importance in cryptography. This section underscores the quantum advantage in solving certain classes of problems more efficiently than classical approaches, illustrating the potential impact of quantum computing on fields like cryptography and number theory.

Calculating the periodic function (Section 3.8): Covers the practical aspects of calculating the periodic function in the context of Shor's algorithm, including the efficient computation of modular exponentiation.

---

### Message 43 (Assistant)
*2024-02-16 23:54:56*

Section 3.8, titled "Calculating the periodic function," focuses on the practical aspects of implementing the calculations required for Shor's algorithm, specifically the computation of the periodic function $f(x) = b^x \mod N$, where $b$ is a base chosen as part of the algorithm and $N$ is the number to be factored. This function's period underpins the factorization process, and efficiently calculating $b^x \mod N$ for large $x$ and $N$ is crucial for the algorithm's success.

The section likely begins by acknowledging the challenge posed by modular exponentiation, especially for large numbers, and then introduces an efficient method for computing $b^x \mod N$ that exploits the properties of modular arithmetic and the capabilities of quantum computers.

One key technique discussed is the repeated squaring method, which is a classic approach to modular exponentiation optimized for quantum computation. This method involves calculating $b^{2^i} \mod N$ for $i = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$, where $n$ is the number of bits needed to represent $x$. These calculations are done sequentially, using the results of previous computations to build up to the final result.

The section might detail a quantum circuit or algorithmic steps for implementing this method, emphasizing how quantum parallelism allows for the simultaneous computation of multiple powers of $b$, significantly speeding up the process compared to classical methods.

Furthermore, the text could explain how this computation fits into the larger framework of Shor's algorithm, specifically how the calculated values of $f(x)$ are used in conjunction with the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) to find the period of $f$, which then leads to the factorization of $N$.

Additionally, the section might address practical considerations and optimizations for implementing the repeated squaring method on a quantum computer, such as minimizing the number of quantum gates needed or dealing with the precision and error rates of quantum operations.

In summary, "Calculating the periodic function" covers the techniques and strategies for efficiently implementing the modular exponentiation at the heart of Shor's algorithm. It bridges the gap between the theoretical underpinnings of quantum period finding and the practical challenges of executing these computations on quantum hardware, highlighting the innovations that make quantum factorization feasible.

The unimportance of small phase errors (Section 3.9): Addresses concerns about the impact of small phase errors in the quantum Fourier transform and demonstrates that they do not significantly affect the algorithm's ability to find periods.

---

### Message 45 (Assistant)

Section 3.9, titled "The unimportance of small phase errors," addresses a crucial aspect of implementing quantum algorithms in practice: the tolerance of Shor's algorithm to small inaccuracies in phase shifts during the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). This section is particularly relevant given the challenges of controlling quantum systems with high precision.

The essence of this section is to reassure that the intrinsic errors in setting the phases during the QFT, which are inevitable due to the technological limitations of quantum computing devices, do not significantly compromise the algorithm's effectiveness in finding the period of a function, which is a critical step in factorizing large numbers.

It likely begins with an acknowledgment of the potential for small phase errors in the execution of quantum gates, especially those involving controlled phase shifts that are essential for the QFT. These errors stem from the practical difficulties in achieving exact control over quantum states.

The discussion would then pivot to a theoretical analysis showing that the outcomes of Shor's algorithm are robust against these small errors. This robustness is partly due to the algorithm's final step involving classical post-processing of quantum measurements, which can tolerate minor inaccuracies in the quantum state without losing the ability to correctly deduce the period of the function being analyzed.

An important concept introduced in this section might be the idea that phase errors alter the probabilities of measurement outcomes without changing the discrete nature of these outcomes themselves. This means that while the likelihood of observing a particular outcome may shift slightly due to phase errors, the set of possible outcomes—and thus the algorithm's ability to identify the period—remains unaffected.

The section could conclude by emphasizing the practical implications of this robustness. It reassures that despite the current limitations of quantum hardware, such as imprecise gate operations and phase control, Shor's algorithm remains viable for factorizing large numbers. This resilience to small errors highlights the algorithm's suitability for real-world quantum computing systems, which will inevitably exhibit some degree of operational imperfection.

In essence, "The unimportance of small phase errors" provides a theoretical foundation for the practical application of Shor's algorithm, affirming that quantum computing's promise for tasks like factorization remains intact despite the challenges of controlling quantum systems with perfect precision.

Section 3.10, titled "Period finding and factoring," elucidates the direct application of quantum period finding in the factorization of large numbers, particularly those that underpin RSA encryption. This part of the chapter is crucial because it bridges the theoretical underpinnings of quantum algorithms with a concrete and impactful application: breaking the RSA encryption scheme, which secures a significant portion of digital communication.

The section likely begins by outlining the connection between the period finding problem and the task of factorizing integers, specifically the product of two large primes. It explains how Shor's algorithm, by efficiently finding the period of certain mathematical functions related to the numbers in question, enables one to deduce prime factors that classical computers cannot efficiently compute.

It introduces the concept of the order of an element within a group, a key mathematical idea that underpins the period-finding approach. The order of an element, in this context, refers to the smallest number $r$ such that a given number $a$ raised to the power of $r$, modulo $N$ (where $N$ is the number to be factored), equals one. The ability to find this $r$ efficiently is what gives quantum computers their edge in factoring.

The narrative then likely shifts to a detailed explanation of how, once the period $r$ is known, one can employ classical number-theoretic methods to actually find a factor of $N$. This involves using the period to construct equations that, with high probability, reveal a non-trivial factor of $N$. The section might delve into specific conditions under which this approach is guaranteed to work and acknowledge the probabilistic nature of the algorithm, highlighting that while it might not succeed on every single attempt, it succeeds often enough to be practically useful.

Furthermore, this section could discuss the implications of quantum period finding for RSA encryption. RSA's security is based on the assumption that factoring large numbers is computationally infeasible for classical computers. By demonstrating an efficient quantum algorithm for this task, the section underscores the potential vulnerability of RSA encryption in a world with quantum computers powerful enough to run Shor's algorithm.

In conclusion, "Period finding and factoring" ties together the theoretical development of quantum algorithms with a significant application in cryptography. It shows how quantum computing can challenge current cryptographic practices and necessitates the development of new encryption methods resistant to quantum attacks. This discussion not only showcases the power of quantum computing but also marks a pivotal point in understanding the practical consequences of quantum technology on global security infrastructure.

I am in the process of reading the book in your knowledgebase by David Mermin Introduction to Quantum Computing. Please give me a brief outline with section numbers of chapter 4. In subsequent prompts I will be asking for expansion of each section. The text is pasted below of chapter 4. 

Chapter 4
Searching with a quantum computer
4.1 The nature of the search
Suppose you know that exactly one n-bit integer satisfies a certain condition, and suppose you have a black-boxed subroutine that acts on the N = 2n different n-bit integers, outputting 1 if the integer sat- isfies the condition and 0 otherwise. In the absence of any other infor- mation, to find the special integer you can do no better with a classical computer than to apply the subroutine repeatedly to different random numbers until you hit on the special one. If you apply it to M different integers the probability of your finding the special number is M/N. You must test 12 N different integers to have a 50% chance of success.
If, however, you have a quantum computer with a subroutine that
performs such a test, then you can find the special integer with a prob-
ability that is very close to 1 when N is large, using a method that calls √
the subroutine a number of times no greater than (π/4) N.
This very general capability of quantum computers was discovered by Lov Grover, and goes under the name of Grover’s search algorithm. Shor’s period-finding algorithm and Grover’s search algorithm, together with their various modifications and extensions, constitute
the two masterpieces of quantum-computational software.
One can think of Grover’s black-boxed subroutine in various ways.
The subroutine might perform a mathematical calculation to determine
whether the input integer is the special one. Here is a simple example. If
an odd number p can be expressed as the sum of two squares, m2 + n2,
then since one of m or n must be even and the other odd, p must be of
the form 4k + 1. It is a fairly elementary theorem of number theory that
if p is a prime number of the form 4k + 1 then it can always be expressed
as the sum of two squares, and in exactly one way. (Thus 5 = 4 + 1,
13=9+4, 17=16+1, 29=25+4, 37=36+1, 41=25+16,
53 = 49 + 4, 61 = 36 + 25, etc.) Given any such prime p, the simple-
would have to calculate p − x2 for nearly a million x to have a better than even chance of succeeding. But using Grover’s procedure with an appropriately programmed quantum computer you could succeed
minded way to find the two squares is to take randomly selected integers
√ youfindtheoneforwhich p−x2 isanintegera.If p isofthe
p/2, until order of a trillion, then following the simple-minded procedure you

4.2 THE GROVER ITERATION 89
 with a probability of success extremely close to 1 by calling the quantum
subroutine that evaluated p − x2 fewer than a thousand times.
Mathematically well-informed friends tell me that for this particular
example there are ways to proceed with a classical computer that are
much more efficient than random testing, but the quantum algorithm to
be described below enables even mathematical ignoramuses, equipped
 with a quantum computer, to do better than random testing by a fac-
tor of 1/ N. And Grover’s algorithm will provide this speed-up on arbitrary problems.
Alternatively, the black box could contain Qbits that have been loaded with a body of data – for example alphabetically ordered names and phone numbers – and one might be looking for the name that went with a particular phone number. It is with this kind of application in mind that Grover’s neat trick has been called searching a database. Using as precious a resource as Qbits, however, merely to store clas- sical information would be insanely extravagant, given our current or even our currently foreseeable ability to manufacture Qbits. Finding a unique solution – or one of a small number of solutions, as described in Section 4.3 – to a tough mathematical puzzle seems a more promising application.
4.2 The Grover iteration
Grover’s algorithm assumes that we have been given a quantum search subroutine that indicates, when presented with any n-bit integer x, whether or not x is the special a being sought, returning this informa- tion as the value of a function f (x) satisfying
f(x)=0, x ̸=a; f(x)=1, x =a. (4.1)
Grover discovered a completely general way to do significantly better than the classical method of merely letting the subroutine operate on different numbers from the list of 2n candidates until it produces the output 1. The quantum-computational speed-up relies on the usual implementation of the subroutine that calculates f , in the form of a unitary transformation Uf that acts on an n-Qbit input register that contains x and a 1-Qbit output register that is or is not flipped from 0 to 1, depending on whether x is or is not the special number a:
U f |x⟩n |y⟩1 = |x⟩n |y ⊕ f (x)⟩1. (4.2)
An example of a simple circuit that has precisely this action is shown in Figure 4.1. The figure can be viewed as providing a minimalist version of Grover’s algorithm, reminiscent of the Bernstein–Vazirani problem (Section 2.4), though not susceptible to the special trick that worked in that simpler case. In this minimalist example we are given a black box containing the circuit depicted in Figure 4.1, but are not told

f (x) = 0, x ̸= a;
f (x) = 1, x = a. The input register has n = 5 Qbits and the special number a is 10010. The 6-Qbit gate in the center of the figure is a five-fold-controlled-NOT, which acts on the computational basis to flip the target bit if and only if every one of the five control bits is in the state |1⟩. The construction of such a gate out of more elementary gates is shown in Figures 4.4–4.7.

  which of the n control Qbits are acted on by NOT gates – information
specified by the unknown n-bit integer a. If there were n Qbits in the
input register and the computer were classical, we could do no better
than to try each of the N = 2n possible inputs until we found the one
for which the output register was flipped. But using Grover’s algorithm
we can determine this information with probability quite close to 1, by
invoking the search subroutine no more than N = 2n/2 times – more √
precisely (π/4) N times – when N is large.
As in the Bernstein–Vazirani problem, it is useful to alter the flip of
the state of the output register into an overall sign change, by trans- forming the 1-Qbit output register into the state

where |a⟩⟨a| is the projection operator1 on the state |a⟩.
As we shall see, U f is the only unitary transformation appearing in Grover’s algorithm that acts as anything other than the identity on the output register. Because the output register starts in the state H|1⟩,unentangledwiththeinputregister,andbecauseUf maintains the output register in this particular state, the output register remains unentangled with the input register and in the state H|1⟩ throughout Grover’s algorithm. We could continue to describe things in terms of Uf andretainthe1-Qbitoutputregister,expanding(4.6),forexample,

U f (|⟩ ⊗ H|1⟩) = [|⟩ − 2|a⟩⟨a|⟩] ⊗ H|1⟩. (4.8)

To execute Grover’s algorithm, we once again initially transform the n-Qbit input register into the uniform superposition of all possible inputs,

|φ⟩=H |0⟩n =
In addition to V, Grover’s algorithm requires a second n-Qbit unitary W that acts on the input register in a manner similar to V, but with a fixed form that does not depend on a. The unitary transformation W preserves the component of any state along the standard state |φ⟩ given in (4.9), while changing the sign of its component orthogonal to |φ⟩:
W = 2|φ⟩⟨φ| − 1, (4.10)
where |φ⟩⟨φ| is the projection operator on the state |φ⟩. We defer to Section 4.3 the not entirely obvious question of how to build W out of 1- and 2-Qbit unitary gates.
Given implementations of V and W, Grover’s algorithm is quite straightforward. It consists of simply applying many times the product WV to the input register, taken initially to be in the state |φ⟩. Each such application requires one invocation of the search subroutine.

 So we can write V as

  Fig 4.2
  Real linear combinations of the special
state |a⟩, and the uniform superposition
|φ⟩ = 2−n/2 |x⟩, define a plane in which these two states are very nearly orthogonal. The state |a⊥⟩ in that plane is orthogonal to |a⟩, and therefore makes a small angle θ with |φ⟩. The unitary transformation V takes any vector in the plane into its reflection in the line through the origin along |a⊥⟩, so it leaves |a⊥⟩ invariant. The unitary transformation W takes any vector in the plane into its reflection in the line through the origin along |φ⟩, so it rotates |a⊥⟩ counterclockwise through the angle 2θ. Therefore the combined operation WV rotates |a⊥⟩ counterclockwise through 2θ, and since WV is a rotation it does the same to any vector in the plane.

          To see what is accomplished by repeatedly applying WV to the initial state |φ⟩, note that both V and W acting on either |φ⟩ or |a⟩ give linear combinations of these two states. Since ⟨a|φ⟩ = ⟨φ|a⟩ = 1/2n/2, whatever the value of a, the linear combinations have real coefficients and are given by
V|a⟩ = −|a⟩, W|φ⟩ = |φ⟩,
V|φ⟩ = |φ⟩ − 2 |a⟩;

So if we start with the state |φ⟩ and let any sequence of these two operators act successively, the states that result will always remain in the two-dimensional plane spanned by real linear combinations of |φ⟩ and |a⟩. Finding the result of repeated applications of WV to the initial state |φ⟩ reduces to an exercise in plane geometry.
It follows from the form (4.9) of |φ⟩ that |φ⟩ and |a⟩, considered as vectors in the plane of their real linear combinations, are very nearly perpendicular, since the cosine of the angle γ between them is given by
√
cos γ = ⟨a|φ⟩ = 2−n/2 = 1/ N, (4.12)
which is small when N is large. It is convenient to define |a⊥⟩ to be the normalized real linear combination of |φ⟩ and |a⟩ that is strictly orthogonal to |a⟩ and makes the small angle θ = π/2 − γ with |φ⟩, as illustrated in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. Since

  Since the rotation WV rotates any vector in
the plane of real linear combinations of |a⟩ and |φ⟩ clockwise through an angle 2θ, it takes |φ⟩ into a vector WV|φ⟩ that makes an angle 3θ with |a⊥⟩. This can also be seen directly from the separate behaviors of V and W: V takes |φ⟩ into its mirror image in |a⊥⟩, and W then takes V|φ⟩ into its mirror image in |φ⟩.

Since W leaves |φ⟩ invariant and reverses the direction of any vector orthogonal to |φ⟩, its geometrical action on any vector in the two- dimensional plane containing |φ⟩,|a⟩, and |a⊥⟩ is simply to replace the vector by its reflection in the mirror line through the origin along |φ⟩. On the other hand V reverses the direction of |a⟩ while leaving any vector orthogonal to |a⟩ invariant, so it acts on a general vector in the two-dimensional plane by replacing it with its reflection in the mirror line through the origin along |a⊥⟩. The product WV, being a product of two two-dimensional reflections, is a two-dimensional rotation.2 The angle of that rotation is most easily seen by considering the effect of WV on |a⊥⟩ (see Figure 4.2). The application of V leaves |a⊥⟩ invariant, and the subsequent action of W on |a⊥⟩ reflects it in the line through the origin along the direction of |φ⟩. So the net effect of the rotation WV on |a⊥⟩ is to rotate |a⊥⟩ past |φ⟩ through a total angle that is twice the angle θ between |a⊥⟩ and |φ⟩.
Because WV is a rotation, the result of applying it to any other vector in the plane is also to rotate that vector through the angle 2θ in the direction from |a⊥⟩ to |φ⟩. So applying WV to the initial state |φ⟩ gives a vector rotated away from |a⊥⟩ by 3θ, since |φ⟩ is already rotated away from |a⊥⟩ by θ (Figure 4.3). Applying WV a second time results in a vector rotated away from |a⊥⟩ by 5θ, and each subsequent application of WV increases the angle between the final state and |a⊥⟩

The product of two such three-dimensional rotations is also a rotation, takes the plane into itself, and does not reverse the third orthogonal direction, so it is a two-dimensional rotation in the plane.

 by another 2θ. Since θ is very close to 2−n/2, after an integral number of applications as close as possible to
(π/4)2n/2, (4.15)
the resulting state will be very nearly orthogonal to |a⊥⟩ in the plane spanned by |φ⟩ and |a⟩ – i.e. it will be very nearly equal to |a⟩ itself.
Consequently a measurement of the input register in the computa- tional basis will yield a with a probability very close to 1. We can check to see whether we have been successful by “querying the oracle.” If
f (a) is 1, as it will be with very high probability, this confirms that we have found the desired a. If we were unlucky we might have to repeat the whole procedure a few more times before achieving success.
4.3 How to construct W
It remains to specify how to construct W out of 1- and 2-Qbit unitary gates. Now −W works just as well as W for purposes of the search algorithm, since it leads to a final state that differs, if at all, only by a harmless overall minus sign. It follows from (4.9) and (4.10) and the fact that H⊗n is its own inverse that
−W=1−2|φ⟩⟨φ|=H⊗n(1−2|00...00⟩⟨00...00|)H⊗n, (4.16)
so we need a gate that acts as the identity on every computational- basis state except |00 . . . 00⟩, which it multiplies by −1. This is just the action of an (n − 1)-fold-controlled-Z gate, with the roles of the 1-Qbit states |0⟩ and |1⟩ interchanged. This interchange is accomplished by sandwiching the (n − 1)-fold-controlled-Z between X⊗n gates, and we therefore have
−W = H⊗nX⊗n(cn−1Z)X⊗nH⊗n. (4.17)
Fig 4.4
  The
n -fold-controlled- Z
transformation, cn Z, acts as the identity on states of the computational basis unless all n control Qbits are in the state |1⟩, when it acts on the target Qbit as Z. Here it is constructed out of doubly controlled gates, using an additional n − 2 ancilliary Qbits, all initially in the state |0⟩. One uses 2(n − 2) c2X (Toffoli) gates and a c2Z gate. The construction is illustrated for the case n = 5. The top three wires are the three ancillary Qbits. The next five wires from the top are the five control Qbits, and the bottom wire is the target Qbit. One easily verifies (by applying the circuit to computational- basis states, with each of the ancillary Qbits in the state |0⟩) that Z acts on the target Qbit if and only if every one of the five control Qbits is in the state |1⟩. The Toffoli gates are symmetrically disposed on both sides of the diagram to ensure that at the end of the process each of the three ancillary Qbits is set back to its initial state |0⟩. This is essential if the ancillary Qbits are not to become entangled with the Qbits on which the Grover iteration acts, represented by the bottom six wires.

     Fig 4.5
  An improved version of Figure 4.4, with twice as many gates. Gates have been added on the left and right to ensure that the circuit works for arbitrary initial computational-basis states of the three ancillary Qbits at the top, restoring them to their initial states at the end of the computation. To see this note that because Toffoli gates or c2Z gates are their own inverses, the circuit acts as the identity on those computational-basis states of all nine Qbits in which any one of the five control Qbits (second through sixth wires from the bottom) is in the state |0⟩, regardless of the computational-basis states of the other Qbits. This is because, as an examination of the figure reveals, replacing the gate governed by any one of the five control Qbits by the identity always results in a pairwise cancellation of all the remaining gates. It remains only to confirm that when all five control Qbits are in the state |1⟩, the circuit acts as Z on the target Qbit at the bottom, and the state of the three ancillary Qbits at the top is unchanged. This is established in Figure 4.6, which shows the operation of the gates in Figure 4.5 when the five control Qbits are all in the state |1⟩. Because X = HZH one can also use this circuit to produce a multiply- controlled-NOT gate, by applying Hadamard gates to the bottom wire on the far right and left.
  We can construct W by constructing cn−1Z, the (n−1)-fold- controlled-Z.
Figure 4.4 shows a straightforward but not terribly efficient way to make a cn−1Z gate for the case n = 6. We use n − 3 ancillary Qbits, all initially in the state |0⟩, 2(n − 3) c2X (Toffoli) gates, and one c2Z gate. As explained in Section 2.6, these can all be built out of 1- and 2-Qbit gates. It is essential for the success of the algorithm that each ancillary Qbit be restored to its initial state |0⟩, since our analysis of the Grover algorithm assumes that the input and output registers have states of their own, unentangled with any other Qbits, after each application of W and V.

  Part (a) reproduces what remains of Figure 4.5 when all five
control Qbits are in the state |1⟩. One easily verifies that two identical cNOT gates, separated by a NOT acting on their control Qbit, have exactly the same action on the computational basis as NOT gates acting on both the control and target Qbits. As a result each of the two identical sets of five adjacent gates acting on the three ancillary Qbits at the top of part (a) reduces simply to three NOT gates, as shown in part (b). Making this further simplification in part (a), note that because each of the three ancillary Qbits is acted on by two NOT gates, its state is unaltered. The two NOT gates acting on the upper wire also ensure that precisely one of the two cZ gates applies Z to the bottom Qbit, whatever the state of the upper wire.

                     The construction of Figure 4.4 is rather expensive in Qbits, requir- ing n − 3 ancillas to apply the algorithm to an n-bit set of possibilities for the special number a. At a cost of four times as many Toffoli gates, one can reduce the number of ancillas to a single one, regardless of the size of n. The way to do this is developed in Figures 4.5–4.7. Figures 4.5 and 4.6 show how nearly doubling the number of gates makes it possible for the construction of Figure 4.4 to work for arbitrary initial states of the ancillas. Figure 4.7 then shows how, by an additional doubling, one can, with the aid of a single ancilla, divide an n-fold-controlled-Z into two multiply-controlled-NOT gates and two multiply-controlled-Z gates, each acting on about 12 n Qbits. (Since X = HZH, one can convert a multiply-controlled-Z gate into a multiply-controlled-NOT gate by applying Hadamard gates to the target Qbit at the beginning and end of the circuit.) The multiply-controlled-Z gates in Figure 4.7 are able nondisruptively to use the control Qbits of the multiply-controlled- NOT gates as their ancillary Qbits in the construction of Figure 4.5. And the multiply-controlled-NOT gates in Figure 4.7 can make similar use of the control Qbits of the multiply-controlled-Z gates.
4.4 Generalization to several special numbers
If there are several special numbers, essentially the same algorithm can be used to find one of them, if we know how many there are. The function f in (4.1) now becomes
f(x) = 0, x ̸= a1,..., am; f(x) = 1, x = a1,..., am. (4.18)

  The identity illustrated by the circuit is easily confirmed. There is only one ancilla, whose state is left unchanged. By introducing circuits of the form in Figure 4.5 into this circuit one can produce cn Z or cn X gates with the aid of just a single ancilla. (Since
X = HZH Figure 4.5 works for either type.) In constructing each of the multiply-controlled-NOT gates in Figure 4.7 out of Toffoli gates, one can borrow the control Qbits of the multiply-controlled-Z gates to use as ancillary Qbits in the expansions of Figure 4.5, since those expansions work whatever the state of their ancillary Qbits, and restore that state to its original form. For the same reasons one can also borrow the control Qbits of the multiply-controlled-NOT gates to construct the multiply-controlled-Z gates.
  The n-Qbit unitary transformation V extracted from (4.4) becomes one whose action on computational-basis states in the input register is given by
V|x⟩ = |x⟩, x ̸= a1,..., am; V|x⟩ = −|x⟩, If we replace the state |a⟩ by
1m |ψ⟩= √ |ai⟩,
m i=1
x = a1,..., am. (4.19)
(4.20)
then starting with |φ⟩, which continues to have the form (4.9), the transformations V and W now keep the state of the input register in the two-dimensional plane spanned by the real linear combinations of |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩. The unitary transformation V changes the sign of |ψ⟩ but preserves the linear combination of |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ orthogonal to |ψ⟩, so V is now a reflection in the line through the origin along the vector |ψ⊥⟩ perpendicular to |ψ⟩ in the plane. Everything else is just as in the case of a single special number except that now the angle  between |ψ⊥⟩ and |φ⟩ satisfies

4.5 Searching for one out of four items
The simplest nontrivial application of Grover’s algorithm is to the case
n = 2, or N = 4. (When n = 1 a single invocation of the subroutine
suffices to identify a even with a classical computer.) When n = 2,
(4.13) tells us that sin θ = 1 , so θ = 30◦. Consequently 3θ = 90◦, and 2
the probability of identifying a with a single invocation of the subrou- tine is exactly 1.
This is a significant improvement on the classical computer, with which one can do no better than trying each of the four possibilities for a in random order. It is equally likely that the marked item will be the first, second, third, or fourth on the list. Since the probability is 14 that the marked item is first on the list, 14 that it is second, and
1 + 1 = 1 that it is third or fourth, the mean number of attempts 442
is1 ×1+1 ×2+1 ×3=21.(Itisnotnecessarytomakeafourth 4424
attempt, since if the first three attempts fail to produce a, then one knows that a is the one remaining untested number.)
The case n = 2 is also special in that one does not have to resort to the elaborate procedure specified in Figures 4.4–4.7 to produce the n-fold-controlled-Z gate. A single Toffoli gate sandwiched between Hadamards on the target Qbit does the job.

In Section 4.1, "The Nature of the Search," the text introduces the foundational concept of quantum search by focusing on the problem of identifying a unique n-bit integer that meets a specific condition, utilizing a quantum subroutine. This challenge is set within a context where a subroutine, functioning as a black box, can test each n-bit integer, signaling with an output of 1 if the integer satisfies the given condition and 0 otherwise.

In the classical computing paradigm, absent any additional information to guide the search, the approach would entail applying the subroutine to random numbers sequentially until the special number is found. This brute-force method requires, on average, testing half of all possible integers (N/2, where N = 2^n) to achieve a 50% success probability, illustrating a linear relationship between the number of attempts and the size of the search space.

Contrastingly, the quantum computing approach, specifically utilizing Grover's algorithm, presents a profound efficiency improvement. Grover's algorithm exploits the principles of quantum superposition and interference to conduct the search, enabling the special integer to be found with a significantly reduced number of subroutine calls. Remarkably, the algorithm achieves this with a complexity of O(√N), meaning the number of steps needed grows only as the square root of the size of the search space. This section elucidates the general capability of quantum computers to perform search tasks more efficiently than classical computers, highlighting Grover's algorithm as one of the seminal achievements in quantum computational algorithms.

Grover's algorithm is presented not only as a method for solving abstract mathematical problems but also as a technique with practical implications, such as searching a database or solving complex computational puzzles. This shift from classical to quantum search methods underscores a fundamental advantage of quantum computing: the ability to solve certain types of problems more efficiently than is possible with classical computers, offering insights into the broader implications and potential applications of quantum algorithms in solving real-world problems.

Section 4.2, "The Grover Iteration," delves into the heart of Grover's algorithm, providing a detailed explanation of its central mechanism: the Grover iteration. This iterative process significantly enhances the efficiency of quantum search by leveraging quantum mechanics' unique properties to identify a specific n-bit integer (the "special number") that satisfies a predefined condition.

The section begins by defining the quantum search subroutine's objective: to ascertain whether any given n-bit integer is the sought-after special number, a. The subroutine's effectiveness is encapsulated by a function f(x), which outputs 1 if x equals a (the condition is met) and 0 otherwise. The quantum implementation of this subroutine is conceptualized as a unitary operation, Uf, acting on an n-qubit input register and a single qubit output register. This operation conditionally flips the output qubit based on whether the input integer x matches the special number, effectively embedding the classical function f(x) into a quantum circuit.

Grover discovered that rather than applying the subroutine to individual numbers sequentially, a quantum computer could employ a superposition of all possible inputs, thus exploring the entire search space simultaneously. The Grover iteration, a composite of the unitary operation Uf and additional quantum operations, amplifies the amplitude of the state corresponding to the special number. This amplification makes the quantum state of the special number significantly more likely to be observed upon measurement, thus providing a quadratic speed-up over classical search methods.

The section underscores the Grover iteration's significance in achieving quantum computational speed-up. By iteratively applying the Grover iteration to the superposed quantum state, the algorithm systematically increases the probability of measuring the special number. This process contrasts sharply with classical search strategies, offering a compelling illustration of quantum computing's potential to outperform classical computing in specific problem domains.

Moreover, the Grover iteration exemplifies the power of quantum parallelism and interference, as it manipulates the phases of quantum states to converge on the correct solution. The explanation of the Grover iteration in this section lays the foundation for understanding how quantum algorithms can exploit the principles of quantum mechanics to solve problems more efficiently than their classical counterparts, marking a pivotal advancement in the field of quantum computing.

Section 4.3, "How to Construct W," focuses on the technicalities of creating the W operator, a pivotal part of Grover's algorithm. The W operator, also known as the "diffusion operator" or "inversion about the average" operator, is critical for Grover's algorithm to function correctly. It effectively inverts the amplitude of each state around the average amplitude, amplifying the probability amplitude of the target state, thereby making it more likely to be observed upon measurement.

This section explains how the W operator is constructed using quantum gates, a foundational element in quantum computing that manipulates qubits and their superpositions. Specifically, it outlines how to build the W operator from basic quantum gates, such as Hadamard (H) and controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates, and introduces more complex constructs like the multi-controlled Z gate.

The construction of W involves several steps:
1. **Initial Transformation**: It begins with the application of Hadamard gates to all qubits, creating a superposition state that evenly distributes amplitude across all possible states.
2. **Application of the Unitary Gate**: The section describes creating a gate that acts as the identity on all states except the |0...0⟩ state, to which it applies a phase shift. This specific action is crucial for the W operator's ability to invert amplitudes about the average.
3. **Implementation Details**: Detailed instructions on using ancillary qubits (ancillas) and specific gate configurations to realize the necessary unitary transformations are provided. The use of ancillary qubits is essential for implementing complex quantum operations that cannot be directly realized with basic quantum gates.

The construction of the W operator showcases the ingenuity required to translate abstract quantum algorithmic steps into practical, implementable quantum circuit designs. This process involves a deep understanding of quantum mechanics principles and the ability to manipulate quantum states precisely.

The paragraph discusses the complexities and ingenuity involved in translating the theoretical aspects of quantum algorithms into concrete quantum circuit designs, specifically focusing on the construction of the W operator within Grover's algorithm. This transition from theory to practice is not straightforward and requires a nuanced understanding of quantum mechanics and quantum computing principles.

**Understanding Quantum Mechanics Principles**: Quantum mechanics underpins the behavior of quantum systems, including qubits, which are the basic units of quantum information. The principles of superposition and entanglement, for instance, allow qubits to exist in multiple states simultaneously and be interconnected in ways that classical bits cannot. Designing quantum circuits, like those involving the W operator, necessitates a deep understanding of these principles to manipulate quantum states effectively and achieve the desired computational outcomes.

**Manipulating Quantum States Precisely**: Quantum state manipulation involves the precise control of qubits through quantum gates, which change the state of qubits in predefined ways. The construction of the W operator involves using a combination of basic quantum gates (e.g., Hadamard gates) and more complex operations (e.g., multi-controlled Z gates) to achieve a specific transformation of quantum states. This precise manipulation is crucial for amplifying the probability amplitude of the target state in Grover's algorithm, thereby making it more likely to be measured.

**Insights into Grover's Algorithm**: Grover's algorithm is renowned for its ability to search unsorted databases quadratically faster than any classical algorithm. The W operator plays a critical role in this quantum speed-up by inverting the amplitude of quantum states about their average, thus amplifying the target state. Understanding the construction of the W operator provides insights into how quantum algorithms harness the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve computational efficiencies beyond classical computing capabilities.

**Challenges and Strategies in Quantum Circuit Design**: Designing quantum circuits that implement complex algorithms like Grover's requires not only technical knowledge of quantum computing but also creativity in circuit design. The construction of the W operator exemplifies the challenges faced in quantum circuit design, such as the need for ancillary qubits and the implementation of gates that are not natively supported by quantum hardware. It also highlights strategies to overcome these challenges, such as decomposing complex operations into sequences of simpler gates and creatively using ancillary qubits to facilitate necessary operations without affecting the overall computation.

**Emphasizing Creativity and Technical Knowledge**: The process of constructing quantum circuits for algorithms like Grover's underscores the blend of creativity and technical expertise required in quantum computing.

Grover's algorithm leverages the unique properties of quantum mechanics to perform unsorted database searches with a quadratic speed-up compared to the best possible classical algorithm. The essence of this quantum advantage lies in the algorithm's use of superposition and interference, with the W operator (also known as the "diffusion operator") being pivotal in realizing this quantum speed-up.

### Mathematical Formalism of Grover's Algorithm

Grover's algorithm can be described in a sequence of steps that highlight the role of the W operator:

1. **Initialization**: The algorithm starts with an $n$-qubit register initialized in the state $|0\rangle^n$. A Hadamard gate $H$ is applied to each qubit, creating a uniform superposition of all possible states:
   $$ |\psi\rangle = H^{\otimes n} |0\rangle^n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} |x\rangle. $$

2. **Oracle Query**: An oracle $U_f$ is then applied, which flips the amplitude of the state corresponding to the solution:
   $$ U_f |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \left( \sum_{x \neq a} |x\rangle - |a\rangle \right), $$
   where $|a\rangle$ is the target state.

3. **Amplitude Amplification (Grover Iteration)**: This step involves the application of the Grover iteration, which consists of two parts: the oracle query and the application of the W operator. The W operator is defined as:
   $$ W = 2|\psi\rangle\langle\psi| - I, $$
   where $|\psi\rangle$ is the initial uniform superposition state and $I$ is the identity operator.

The action of the W operator can be understood as reflecting the quantum states about the average amplitude. Mathematically, if we consider a state vector in which the amplitude of the target state $|a\rangle$ has been flipped by the oracle, the application of $W$ amplifies this state's amplitude while suppressing the others. This is because $W$ effectively inverts the amplitude of each state about the average amplitude of the system, thereby increasing the probability amplitude of the target state in each iteration.

4. **Repeated Application**: The oracle query and the W operator are applied repeatedly, approximately $\sqrt{2^n}$ times, which is where the quadratic speed-up comes from. Each application of the Grover iteration increases the amplitude of the target state, making it more likely to be observed upon measurement.

### Quantum Speed-up

The quadratic speed-up achieved by Grover's algorithm is significant because it demonstrates that for certain problems, quantum algorithms can fundamentally outperform their classical counterparts. While a classical search algorithm would require $O(2^n)$ evaluations to find the target item with certainty in an unsorted database of $2^n$ items, Grover's algorithm requires only $O(\sqrt{2^n})$ evaluations.

### Conclusion

Understanding the W operator's construction and its role in Grover's algorithm provides deep insights into how quantum algorithms exploit quantum mechanical principles—such as superposition and interference—to achieve computational efficiencies unattainable by classical algorithms. This highlights the transformative potential of quantum computing in solving certain classes of problems more efficiently than ever before.

*2024-02-17 13:56:05*

This section of the chapter delves into an extension of Grover's algorithm, adapting it for scenarios where multiple target solutions (special numbers) exist within the search space. The original Grover's algorithm is designed to find a single unique solution with a quadratic speed-up compared to classical search algorithms. However, practical problems often involve finding one of many possible solutions, necessitating a generalization of the algorithm.

### Adapting Grover's Algorithm for Multiple Solutions

The algorithm's adaptation to handle multiple special numbers involves a modification in the oracle and the interpretation of the algorithm's outcome. The oracle function $f(x)$, which previously identified a single special number, is now defined to recognize any of the multiple special numbers:

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } x \neq a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m; \\
1 & \text{if } x = a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m.
\end{cases}
$$

Here, $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_m$ represent the $m$ special numbers among the $N = 2^n$ possible numbers. The presence of multiple target states changes the dynamics of the amplitude amplification process, influencing the algorithm's efficiency and the number of iterations required to maximize the probability of finding a solution.

### Quantum Speed-up with Multiple Solutions

The quantum speed-up of Grover's algorithm remains significant even with multiple solutions, but the number of iterations needed for optimal amplification of the target states' probability amplitudes changes. The optimal number of iterations is now approximately proportional to $\sqrt{N/m}$, reflecting the influence of the number of solutions on the search efficiency. This adjustment ensures that the algorithm still performs quadratically faster than any classical search algorithm, albeit with a modified iteration count to account for the increased likelihood of finding a target state due to multiple solutions.

### Implications for Algorithm's Efficiency

The generalization of Grover's algorithm to accommodate multiple special numbers introduces a nuanced consideration for its practical implementation. Knowing the number of solutions $m$ or estimating it closely becomes important for setting the number of iterations. If the exact number of solutions is unknown, additional quantum techniques, such as quantum counting, can be employed to estimate $m$ before executing the adapted Grover's algorithm.

This generalization underscores the versatility of Grover's algorithm in solving a broader range of search problems. By adjusting the algorithm to handle multiple solutions, quantum computing can be applied to more complex scenarios where finding any one of several acceptable answers suffices. This expands the practical applications of quantum computing in fields such as database searching, optimization problems, and pattern recognition, showcasing the adaptability of quantum algorithms to real-world challenges.

The section 4.5 "Searching for One Out of Four Items" offers a concrete illustration of Grover's algorithm applied to the simplest nontrivial scenario—a search space with only four possible items. This example is pivotal for understanding the algorithm's operation and its quantum advantage in a more intuitive and accessible manner.

### Context and Setup

In this scenario, we are tasked with identifying one special item (marked item) out of a total of four. The search space is thus defined by $n = 2$, leading to $N = 2^n = 4$ possible items. This situation is relatable to a real-world problem where a small dataset contains one item of interest, and we must find it with the least effort.

### Quantum Search Process

Grover's algorithm, when applied to this scenario, demonstrates a significant quantum speed-up even in such a small search space. The algorithm leverages superposition and amplitude amplification to increase the probability of measuring the state corresponding to the special item.

- **Initialization:** All four possible states are initialized in a superposition, ensuring each has an equal probability of being observed.
- **Grover Iteration:** The Grover iteration process—consisting of the oracle query and the inversion about the mean (amplitude amplification)—is applied. For a search space of four items, the algorithm reaches near-optimal probability amplification for finding the marked item in just one iteration.

### Quantum Advantage Illustrated

The beauty of this example lies in its simplicity and the clear quantum advantage it showcases. Classical search methods, even in this minimal scenario, would require checking each item one by one, on average needing $2.5$ tries to find the special item (with a guaranteed find in at most 3 tries, assuming the last try is not needed as it's a certainty once all others are checked).

In contrast, Grover's algorithm ensures that the probability of identifying the marked item is maximized with just a single query to the oracle, followed by the Grover iteration. This represents a substantial reduction in the number of steps required, illustrating the quadratic speed-up provided by quantum computing even in the most straightforward cases.

This specific example serves an educational purpose, providing a clear, understandable demonstration of Grover's algorithm's principles. It helps in demystifying quantum computing, showing how quantum principles like superposition and quantum interference can be harnessed to solve practical problems more efficiently than classical computing can.

In summary, the section "Searching for One Out of Four Items" not only elucidates the operational dynamics of Grover's algorithm but also embodies the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize problem-solving across various domains by offering a glimpse into its capabilities through a simple, yet powerful example.

Quantum error correction
5.1 The miracle of quantum error correction
Correcting errors might sound like a dreary practical problem, of little aesthetic or conceptual interest. But aside from being of crucial im- portance for the feasibility of quantum computation, it is also one of the most beautiful and surprising parts of the subject. The surprise is that error correction is possible at all, since the only way to detect errors is to make measurements, but measurement gates disruptively alter the states of the measured Qbits, apparently making things even worse. “Quantum error correction” would seem to be an oxymoron. The beauty lies in the ingenious ways that people have found to get around this apparently insuperable obstacle.
The discovery in 1995 of quantum error correction by Peter Shor and, independently, Andrew Steane had an enormous impact on the prospects for actual quantum computation. It changed the dream of building a quantum computer capable of useful computation from a clearly unattainable vision to a program that poses an enormous but not necessarily insuperable technological challenge.
Error correction is not a major issue for classical computation. In a classical computer the physical systems that embody individual bits – the Cbits – are immense on the atomic scale. The two states of a Cbit representing 0 and 1 are so grossly different that the probability is infinitesimal for flipping from one to the other as a result of thermal fluctuations, mechanical vibrations, or other irrelevant extraneous in- teractions.
Error correction does become important, even classically, in the transmission of information over large distances, because the farther the signal travels, the more it attenuates. One can deal with this in a variety of straightforward or ingenious ways. One of the crudest is to encode each logical bit in three actual bits, replacing |0⟩ and |1⟩ by the codewords
|0⟩ = |0⟩|0⟩|0⟩ = |000⟩, |1⟩ = |1⟩|1⟩|1⟩ = |111⟩. (5.1)
One can then monitor each codeword, checking for flips in any of the individual Cbits and restoring them by applying the principle of majority rule whenever a flip is detected. Monitoring has to take place
99
100 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION
 often enough to make negligible the probability that more than a single bit has flipped in a single codeword between inspections.
Quantum error correction also uses multi-Qbit codewords and also requires monitoring at a rate that renders certain kinds of compound errors highly improbable. But there are several ways in which error correction in a quantum computer is quite different.
(a) A quantum computer, unlike a classical computer, requires error correction. The physical Qbits are individual atomic-scale physical systems such as atoms, photons, trapped ions, or nuclear magnetic moments. Any coupling to anything not under the explicit con- trol of the computer and its program can substantially disrupt the state associated with those Qbits, entangling them with computa- tionally irrelevant features of the computer or the world outside the computer, thereby destroying the computation. For a quantum computer to work without error correction, each Qbit would have to be impossibly well isolated from irrelevant interactions with other parts of the computer and anything else in its environment.
(b) In contrast to classical error correction, checking for errors in a quantum computer is problematic. The obvious way to monitor a Qbit is to measure it. But the result of measuring a Qbit is to alter its state, if it has one of its own, and, more generally, to destroy its quantum correlations with other Qbits with which it might be entangled. Such disruptions are stochastic – i.e. unpredictable – and introduce major errors of their own. One must turn to less obvious forms of monitoring.
(c) Bit flips are not the only errors. There are entirely nonclassical sources of trouble. For example phase errors, such as the alteration of |0⟩ + |1⟩ to |0⟩ − |1⟩, can be just as damaging.
(d) Unlike the discrete all-or-nothing bit-flip errors suffered by Cbits, errors in the state of Qbits grow continuously out of their uncor- rupted state.
We begin our discussion of error correction by examining in
Section 5.2 a simple model of quantum error correction that works when the possible errors are artificially limited to a few specific kinds of disruption. Although this is clearly unrealistic, the error-correction procedure is easy to follow. It also introduces in a simple setting most of the tricks that continue to work in the more realistic case.
5.2 A simplified example
Much of the flavor of quantum error correction is conveyed by an artificially simple model in which the only errors a collection of Qbits is allowed to experience are the classically meaningful errors: random

flips of individual Qbits. We shall examine the more general possibilities for quantum errors in Section 5.3 below.
Bit-flip errors in a computation can be modeled by a circuit that differs from the ideal error-free circuit only in the occasional presence of extraneous 1-Qbit NOT gates. If such randomly occurring error- producing NOT gates are sufficiently rare, then since the only allowed errors are bit-flip errors, one might hope to be able to correct the corruptions they introduce by tripling the number of Qbits and using precisely the 3-Qbit code (5.1) that corrects for bit-flip errors in the classical case. Because of the disruptive effect of measurement gates in diagnosing errors, it is not at all clear that such a 3-Qbit code can be effective for bit-flip errors in the quantum case. It can nevertheless be made to work, though the way in which one does the encoding and performs the error correction is much subtler for Qbits than it is for Cbits.
To begin with, there is the question of encoding. Classically one merely replaces each of the two computational-basis states |x⟩ by the codeword states |x⟩ = |x⟩|x⟩|x⟩, for x = 0 or 1. Qbits, however, can also be in superpositions α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, and one requires a circuit that automatically encodes this into α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ = α|0⟩|0⟩|0⟩ + β|1⟩|1⟩|1⟩ for arbitrary α and β, in the absence of any knowledge of what the values of α and β might be. This can be done with two cNOT gates that target two additional Qbits initially both in the state |0⟩, as illustrated in Figure 5.1:
α|0⟩+β|1⟩=α|0⟩|0⟩|0⟩+β|1⟩|1⟩|1⟩=C21C20 α|0⟩+β|1⟩|0⟩|0⟩. (5.2) Having produced such a 3-Qbit codeword state, we must then guard against its corruption by the possible action of an extraneous NOT gate that acts on at most one of the three Qbits, as illustrated in Figure 5.2. This is easily done for Cbits, for which there are only two possible uncorrupted initial states, |000⟩ and |111⟩, and examining them is unproblematic. To see whether either initial state has been cor- rupted by the action of a single NOT gate, one nondisruptively reads

the three Cbits. If this reveals all three Cbits to be in the same state, there is no corruption to correct. If one of them is found to be in a different state from the other two, that particular Cbit is the one that was acted upon by the extraneous NOT gate, and applying a second NOT gate to that Cbit restores the initial state.
One cannot, however, nondisruptively “read” the state of a collec- tion of Qbits. The only way to extract information is by the action of measurement gates. But measuring any of the three Qbits immediately destroys the uncorrupted superposition
|⟩ = α|000⟩ + β|111⟩, (5.3)
converting it either to |000⟩ (with probability |α|2) or to |111⟩ (with probability |β|2). There is a similar coherence-destroying effect on each of the three possible corrupted states,
|0⟩ = X0|⟩ = α|001⟩ + β|110⟩,
|1⟩ = X1|⟩ = α|010⟩ + β|101⟩, (5.4) |2⟩ = X2|⟩ = α|100⟩ + β|011⟩,
obliterating any dependence of the post-measurement state on the com- plex amplitudes α and β. This might appear (and for some time was thought) to be the end of the story: quantum error correction is im- possible because of the disruptive effect of the measurement needed to diagnose the error.
But there are subtler ways to extract the information needed to di- agnose and correct possible errors. Although there continues to be a disruption in these refined procedures, the damaging effects are shifted from the codeword Qbits to certain ancillary Qbits. By coupling the codeword Qbits to these ancillary Qbits with appropriate 2-Qbit unitary
          
5.2 A SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE 103
 gates, and then applying measurement gates only to the ancillas, one can extract information about certain relations prevailing among the code- word Qbits. This more limited information turns out to be enough to diagnose and correct certain errors in a coherence-preserving manner, without revealing anything about the original uncorrupted codeword state. Acquiring no information about the uncorrupted state is a neces- sary restriction on any error-correction procedure capable of perfectly restoring the uncorrupted state. If one could get even partial infor- mation about the structure of a state without disrupting it, one could continue collecting additional information nondisruptively until one was well on the way to violating the no-cloning theorem.
Note that all possible forms for the uncorrupted 3-Qbit codeword (5.3) – given by assigning all possible values to the amplitudes α and β – lie in a two-dimensional subspace of the full eight-dimensional space containing all possible 3-Qbit states. Furthermore, each of the three allowed corruptions (5.4) also lies in a two-dimensional subspace of the full 3-Qbit space, and the three subspaces containing the three allowed corruptions are each orthogonal to the subspace containing the uncorrupted codeword, and orthogonal to each other. This turns out to be crucial to the success of the enterprise.
More generally, if we wanted to use an n-Qbit codeword in a model in which the only allowed errors were flips of a single Qbit, then we wouldrequire2(1 + n)dimensionstoaccommodatethen + 1mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces associated with a general un- corrupted state and its n different 1-Qbit corruptions. Since all possible states of n Qbits span a 2n -dimensional space, a necessary condition for an n-Qbit bit-flip-error-correcting code to be possible is
2n−1 ≥ 1 + n. (5.5)
The smallest n satisfying (5.5) is n = 3, for which it holds as an equality. This shows that the 3-Qbit code is, in this sense, perfect for the purpose of correcting errors limited to flips of a single Qbit.
Figure 5.3 shows that 3-Qbit codewords, as well as meeting this necessary condition for the correction of quantum bit-flip errors, actu- ally do permit it to be carried out. The error detection and correction requires two additional ancillary Qbits (the upper two wires), initially both in the state |0⟩. Both ancillas are targeted by pairs of cNOT gates controlled by subsets of the three codeword Qbits. Note first that if the 3-Qbit codeword has not been corrupted, so its state remains (5.3), then both the ancillary Qbits remain in the state |0⟩ after the action of the cNOT gates, since the term |000⟩ in the codeword results in none of the target Qbits being flipped, while the term |111⟩ results in both of the target Qbits being flipped twice, which is equivalent to no flip.
In a similar way each of the three corruptions (5.4) results in a different unique final state for the ancillary Qbits. The first of those

 Fig 5.3
   How to detect and correct the three possible single-bit-flip errors shown in Figure 5.2. One requires two ancillary Qbits (the upper two wires), each initially in the state |0⟩, coupled to the codeword Qbits by cNOT gates. After the cNOT gates have acted each ancilla is measured. If both measurements give 0, then none of the erroneous NOT gates on the left have acted and none of the error-correcting NOT gates on the right need to be applied. If the upper measurement gate shows x = 1 and the lower one shows y = 0, then the uppermost of the three erroneous NOT gates has acted on the left. Its action is undone by applying the uppermost of the three NOT gates on the right. The other two possible 1-Qbit errors are similarly corrected.
 corruptions results in |0⟩ for the upper ancilla and |1⟩ for the lower, since either term in the superposition α|001⟩ + β|110⟩ results in zero or two flips for the upper ancilla, and a single flip for the lower ancilla. The next form in (5.4) produces a single flip for both ancillas, resulting in |1⟩ for both. The third results in |1⟩ for the upper and |0⟩ for the lower ancilla.
So if the two ancillary Qbits are measured after the cNOT gates have acted, the four possible readings, 00, 01, 10, and 11, of the two

5.2 A SIMPLIFIED EXAMPLE 105
 measurement gates reveal whether or not a random one of the codeword Qbits has been flipped and, in the event of a flip, which of the three has suffered it. On the basis of this information one can either accept the codeword as uncorrupted or apply a NOT gate to the Qbit that has been identified as the flipped one, thereby restoring the initial uncorrupted state. One easily confirms that this is precisely what is accomplished by the NOT gates on the extreme right of Figure 5.3.
This accomplishes what any valid quantum error-correction pro- cedure must do: it restores the original uncorrupted state without re- vealing any information whatever about what the form of that state – the particular values of the amplitudes α and β – might actually be. The procedure succeeds in preserving the superposition by extracting information only about correlations among the Qbits making up the codeword, without ever extracting information about individual Qbits. Working only with correlations makes it possible to apply a single linear test that works equally well for diagnosing 1-Qbit errors in either |000⟩ or |111⟩, and therefore also works for any superposition of those states.
This simple example of quantum error correction requires the use of measurement gates to diagnose the error. The outputs of the mea- surement gates are noted, and then used to determine which, if any, of a collection of error-correcting NOT gates should be applied. The pro- cedure can be automated into a bigger quantum circuit that eliminates (or almost eliminates) the need to use measurement gates combined with unitary gates, which are or are not applied depending on the read- ings of the measurement gates. This can be achieved by a combination of cNOT and Toffoli gates, controlled by the ancillary Qbits, as shown in Figure 5.4.
Replacing measurement gates by additional cNOT gates does not entirely eliminate the need for measurement, because at the end of the process the state of the ancillary Qbits will depend on the character of the error and will in general no longer be the state |0⟩|0⟩ with which the error-correction procedure starts. If one wishes to reuse these ancillary Qbits for further error correction, it is necessary to reset them to their initial state |0⟩|0⟩. This can efficiently be done by measuring them and applying the appropriate NOT gates if either is found to be in the state |1⟩. Thus measurement gates followed by NOT gates that depend on the measurement outcome are still needed to prepare the circuit for a possible future error correction.
This procedure (automated or not) will continue to work even when the codeword Qbits are entangled with many other codeword Qbits, as they will be in the course of a nontrivial computation. In such a case the codeword Qbits have no state of their own, the state of all the many codeword Qbits being of the form

  Automation of the error-correction process of Figure 5.3. The three controlled gates on the right – one of them a doubly controlled Toffoli gate with multiple targets – have precisely the same error-correcting effect on the three codeword Qbits as does the application of NOT gates contingent on measurement outcomes in Figure 5.3. The final state |⟩ of the ancillas (which is also the state that determines the action of the three controlled gates on the right) is |00⟩ if none of the erroneous NOT gates on the left has acted. It is |10⟩ if only the upper erroneous NOT gate has acted, |11⟩ if only the middle one has acted, and |01⟩ if only the lower one has acted.
  with the error correction applied to the three Qbits on the left. One easily confirms that the added complication of entanglement with other Qbits has no effect on the validity of the error-correction procedure.
There is an alternative way of representing the use of cNOT gates in Figure 5.3 to diagnose the error, which is useful in correcting quantum errors in more realistic cases. The alternative point of view is based on the easily confirmed fact that the uncorrupted state (5.3) is left unaltered by either of the operators Z2Z1 and Z1Z0, while the three corruptions (5.4) are each eigenstates of Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 with distinct

sets of eigenvalues: 1 and −1 in the case of |0⟩; −1 and −1 in the case of |1⟩; and −1 and 1 in the case of |2⟩.
While these last three facts can be confirmed directly from the ex- plicit forms of |0⟩, |1⟩, and |2⟩ on the right of (5.4), it is worth noting, for purposes of comparison with some of the more complex cases that follow, that they also follow from the facts that Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 act as the identity on the uncorrupted state |⟩, that the cor- rupted states are of the form |j⟩ = Xj|⟩, and that Xj commutes withZi wheni ̸= j,whileXj anticommuteswithZj:ZjXj =−XjZj. The resulting pattern of commutations (+) or anticommutations (−) is summarized in Table 5.1.
Thus the joint eigenvalues of the commuting operators Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 distinguish among the uncorrupted state and each of the three possible corruptions. A procedure that takes advantage of this by sandwiching controlled Z2Z1 and controlled Z1Z0 gates between Hadamards acting on the control Qbits is shown in Figure 5.5. Although it takes a little thought to confirm directly from the fig- ure that Figure 5.5 does indeed accomplish error correction – we shall work this out in Section 5.4 as a special case of a much more gen- eral procedure – one can confirm that it does by simply noting that Figure 5.5 is mathematically equivalent to Figure 5.3. This equiva- lence follows from the facts that X = HZH, that H2 = 1, and that the action of controlled- Z is unaltered by exchanging the target and control Qbits.
This oversimplified example, in which only bit-flip errors are al- lowed, illustrates most of the features of quantum error correction that one encounters in more realistic cases. The more general procedure is complicated by the fact that, as noted above and made precise in Section 5.3 below, the general error a Qbit can experience is more complicated than just a single bit flip. As a result, one needs codewords containing more than three Qbits to correct general single-Qbit errors, and one requires more complicated diagnostic and corrective proce- dures than those of Figures 5.3–5.5, involving more than just a pair of ancillary Qbits. But although the codewords and error-correcting

  An apparently unnecessary complication of the error-correcting circuit in Figure 5.3, which transforms it into the more general form described in Section 5.4. The circuit is equivalent to that in Figure 5.3: (1) the cNOT gates in Figure 5.3 can be replaced by controlled-Z gates if Hadamard gates act on each ancilla before and after the controlled gates act; (2) each of the four controlled-Z gates acts in the same way if its control and target Qbits are interchanged; and (3) pairs of controlled gates with the same control Qbit and two different targets can be combined into a single controlled gate with that control Qbit and a 2-Qbit target operation that is just the product of the two 1-Qbit target operations. The part of the circuit between and including the pairs of Hadamards on the right and left is a simple example of the more complex error-diagnosing circuits that appear in Figures 5.8, 5.9, and N.2 (in Appendix N).
  circuits are more elaborate, once we have identified the more general form of quantum errors there are no further conceptual complications in understanding the kinds of procedures that can correct them.
The more general form Qbit errors can assume is discussed in Section 5.3. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that the general 1- Qbit error can be viewed as a simple extension of what we have just

5.3 THE PHYSICS OF ERROR GENERATION 109
 described: in addition to the possibility of an extraneous X gate acting on the Qbit, there might also be an extraneous Z gate or an ext- raneous Y = ZX gate. If we can diagnose and correct for each of these three possible corruptions, then we can correct for arbitrary 1-Qbit errors.
Section 5.4 describes a generalization of the diagnostic scheme we have just exploited for extracting relational information about the Qbits that make up a codeword, by coupling groups of them to ancillary Qbits, which are then measured. It turns out that the operators needed to diagnose the error – generalizations of the operators Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 for the 3-Qbit code – are also useful for defining the more general codewords.
In Section 5.5 we examine two of the most important n-Qbit codes with n > 3 that are able to correct general single-Qbit errors: the 5- Qbit and 7-Qbit codes. The 5-Qbit code is the ideal code for general 1-Qbit errors in the same way that the 3-Qbit code is ideal for bit-flip errors. The 7-Qbit code is more likely to be of practical interest, for reasons we shall describe. The earliest quantum error-correcting code – the 9-Qbit code discovered by Shor – is now of only historical interest, and is relegated to Appendix N.
5.3 The physics of error generation
Errors are not, of course, produced by extra gates accidentally appear- ing in a circuit, as in the oversimplified example of Section 5.2. They are produced by extraneous interactions with the world external to the computer or with computationally irrelevant degrees of freedom of the computer itself. Although one would like the state of the Qbits to evolve only under the action of the unitary transformations imposed by the gates of the computer, inevitably Qbits will interact, even if only weakly, with other physical systems or degrees of freedom having noth- ing to do with the computation in which the Qbits are participating. In a well-designed computer such spurious interactions will be kept to a minimum, but their disruptive effects on the quantum state of the Qbits can grow continuously from zero, in contrast to disruptive effects on Cbits, which have to exceed a large threshold before a Cbit can change its state. In a quantum computer such spurious changes of state will eventually accumulate to the point where the calculation falls apart, unless ongoing efforts are made to eliminate them.
To characterize the most general way in which a Qbit can be deflected from its computational task, we must finally acknowledge that Qbits are not the only things in the world that are described by quantum states. The quantum theory provides the most fundamental description we have of everything in the world, and it describes everything in the world – not just Qbits – by means of quantum states.

110 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION
 This spectacular expansion of the scope of quantum states might not come as a complete surprise to the nonphysicist reader. I have stressed all along that the quantum state of a Qbit or a collection of Qbits is not a property carried by those Qbits, but a way of concisely summarizing everything we know that has happened to them, to enable us to make statistical predictions about the information we might then be able to extract from them. If quantum states are not properties inherent in the system they describe, but states of the knowledge we have managed to acquire about the prior history of the system – if they somehow incorporate fundamental aspects of how we exchange information with the world outside of us – then they might indeed have an applicability going beyond the particular kinds of systems we have applied them to up until now.
Indeed, nowhere in this exposition of quantum computation has it been necessary to refer to the individual character of the Qbits. Whether they are spinning electrons, polarized photons, atoms in cavities, or any number of other things, the quantum-mechanical description of their computational behavior has been exactly the same. So insofar as the assignment of quantum states to physical systems is a general feature of how we come to grips with the external world, it might not be unreasonable to assign a quantum state |e⟩ to whatever part of the world comes into interactive contact with the Qbit or Qbits – their environment. We will not make any specific assumptions about the character of that environment or of the quantum state |e⟩ associated with it, beyond noting that, unlike the state of a single Qbit, the state of the environment is likely to be a state in a space of enormously many dimensions if there is any complexity to the environment that couples, however weakly, to the Qbit.
If, in spite of this recommended point of view, you still feel un- comfortable applying quantum states to noncomputational degrees of freedom, then I invite you to regard |e⟩ as the state of some enormous collection of extra Qbits, from which one would like the computation to be completely decoupled, but which, for reasons beyond our con- trol, somehow manage to interact weakly with the Qbits we are actually interested in. I offer this invitation as a conceptual aid to computer scientists uncomfortable with my claim that quantum states apply to the description of arbitrary physical systems. But I also note that in re- cent years a few physicists have suggested that the entire world should indeed be viewed as an enormous collection of Qbits – a position that has not attracted many adherents to date.
Returning from grand world views to the practical reality of errors in a quantum computation, we shall regard a single Qbit, initially in the state |x⟩ (x = 0 or 1), as being part of a larger system consisting of the Qbit plus its environment, initially in the state |e⟩|x⟩. In the ideal case, as the Qbit evolves under 1-Qbit unitary gates or interacts with other Qbits under 2-Qbit unitary gates, it stays unentangled with

5.3 THE PHYSICS OF ERROR GENERATION 111
 its environment. The environmental component of the state is then irrelevant to the computational process and can be ignored, as we have been doing up to now.
Unfortunately, however, interactions with the environment will in general transform and entangle the states of the Qbit and its environ- ment. The most general way in which this can come about can be expressed in the form
|e⟩|0⟩ → |e0⟩|0⟩ + |e1⟩|1⟩, |e⟩|1⟩ → |e2⟩|0⟩ + |e3⟩|1⟩,
(5.7)
where |e⟩ is the initially uncorrelated state of the environment and |e0⟩, . . ., |e3⟩ are possible final environmental states. The environmen- tal final states are not necessarily orthogonal or normalized, and are constrained only by the requirement that the two states on the right side of (5.7) should be orthogonal, since the Qbit–environment in- teraction is required, like any other physical interaction, to lead to a unitary development in time. This corruption of a computation by the entanglement of the state of Qbits with the state of their environment is called decoherence. It is the primary enemy of quantum computation.
Included in (5.7) are cases like the oversimplified one we examined in Section 5.2, in which the Qbit remains isolated from the environ- ment (|ei ⟩ = ai |e⟩, i = 0, . . ., 3) but still suffers in that isolation an unintended unitary evolution. But (5.7) also includes the case of major practical interest. This is the case in which the interaction with the environment has a small but otherwise quite general entangling effect on the Qbit:
|e0⟩≈|e3⟩≈|e⟩; ⟨e1|e1⟩, ⟨e2|e2⟩≪1. (5.8) In dealing with such entangling interactions with the environment,
it is useful to introduce projection operators
1+(−1)xZ 2
which project onto the 1-Qbit states |x⟩, x = 0, 1. Using these projection operators, we can combine the two time evolutions in (5.7) into a single form:

|e⟩|x⟩ → |e0⟩1 + |e1⟩X P0 |x⟩ + |e2⟩X + |e3⟩1 P1 |x⟩. (5.10)
In (5.10) I have introduced the convenient notation |e⟩U to describe the linear operator from a 1-Qbit to a many-Qbit space that takes the 1-Qbit state |ψ⟩ into the many-Qbit state |e⟩ ⊗ U|ψ⟩; like most embellishments of Dirac notation it is defined so that the appropriate form of the associative law holds:

  There is nothing special about the particular environmental states appearing in (5.13), so we can rewrite it more compactly in terms of four other(ingeneralneithernormalizednororthogonal)states|a⟩,|b⟩,|c⟩, and |d ⟩ of the environment as
|e⟩|x⟩→ |d⟩1+|a⟩X+|b⟩Y+|c⟩Z|x⟩. (5.14)
The time development represented by the arrow in (5.14) is unitary and therefore linear, so the combination of environmental states and unitary operators on the right side of (5.14) acts linearly on |x⟩. Therefore (5.14) holds not only for |e ⟩|0⟩ and |e ⟩|1⟩ but also for any superposition α|e⟩|0⟩+β|e⟩|1⟩=|e⟩α|0⟩+β|1⟩ =|e⟩|ψ⟩,intheform
|e⟩|ψ⟩→ |d⟩1+|a⟩X+|b⟩Y+|c⟩Z|ψ⟩. (5.15)
The actions of X, Z, and Y on the uncorrupted state |ψ⟩ are some- times described as subjecting the Qbit to a bit-flip error, a phase error, and a combined bit-flip and phase error. Using this terminology, a gen- eral environmental degradation of the state of a Qbit, which can always be put in the form (5.15), can be viewed as a superposition of no error (1), a bit-flip error (X), a combined bit-flip and phase error (Y), and a phase error (Z). The oversimplified example of Section 5.2 ignored the possibility of phase errors (Z) and combined errors (Y).
If we were to extend this analysis to the corruption of an n-Qbit codeword | ⟩n , we would end up with a combined state of the codeword and the environment of the form

 single Qbit in a codeword suffers a flip error. If |⟩ is a state of a small number n of Qbits that make up an n-Qbit codeword, then the proba- bility of corruption of the codeword is so small that the terms in (5.16) differing from the term 1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ 1 that reproduces the uncorrupted state are dominated by those in which only a single one of the X(μi ) differs from 1. If this condition is met, then the general form (5.16) of a corrupted n-Qbit codeword is a superposition of terms in which each individual Qbit making up the word has suffered a degradation of the form (5.15):

One can allow for the more general possibility of two or more Qbits in a codeword being corrupted together if one is willing to use longer codewords to correct such errors. The examples of error correction given below are all at the level of single-Qbit errors of the form (5.18) in the codeword. The extent to which the dominant sources of error will actually be of this form may well depend on the kind of physical system used to realize the Qbits. Eventually the theory of quantum error correction will have to face this issue. Meanwhile this possible future source of difficulty should not distract you from appreciating how remarkable it is that an error-correction procedure exists at all, even in the restricted setting of single-Qbit errors.
To correct 1-Qbit errors we require a procedure that restores a corrupted state of the form

where |e⟩ is the environmental state accompanying whichever of the 3n + 1 terms in (5.19) our error-correction procedure has projected the corrupted state onto. If the term in Xi were the only one present in (5.19), we could use a 3-Qbit codeword and achieve this projec- tion by applying precisely the error-correction technique described in Section 5.2. But to deal with the additional possibilities associated with thetermsinYi andZi werequirelongercodewordsandmoreelaborate diagnostic methods.
5.4 Diagnosing error syndromes
Before turning to specific quantum error-correcting codes, it is useful to anticipate the general structure of the gates we will be using to identify

114 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION
 and project onto a particular term in the general 1-Qbit corruption (5.19) of a codeword. As noted earlier, these will be generalizations of the controlled Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 gates used to diagnose errors in the artificial case in which only bit-flip errors are allowed.
Let A be any n-Qbit Hermitian operator whose square is the unit operator:
A2 = 1. (5.21)
It follows from (5.21) that A is unitary, since A† = A. The eigenvalues of A can only be 1 or −1, since A acting twice on an eigenstate must act as the identity 1. The projection operators onto the subspaces of states with eigenvalue +1 and −1 are, respectively,
1+A 1−A
PA = and PA = . (5.22)
  02 12
Since P0 + P1 = 1, any state |ψ⟩ can be expressed as a superposition of its projections onto these two subspaces: |ψ⟩ = P0|ψ⟩ + P1|ψ⟩.
The operators Z2Z1 and Z1Z0 encountered in the 3-Qbit code for correcting bit-flip errors are examples of such A. In the more general cases we shall be examining, the operators A will be more general products of both Z and X operators associated with different Qbits in the codeword; for example A = Z4X3Z2X1X0.
In addition to the n Qbits on which A acts, we introduce an ancillary Qbit and consider the controlled operator CA, which we write here in the alternative form cA to avoid having subscripts on superscripts, which acts as A on the n Qbits when the state of the ancilla is |1⟩ and as the identity when the state of the ancilla is |0⟩. If the state of the ancilla is a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩, the action of cA is defined by linearity. When A is a product of 1-Qbit operators, the operator cA can be taken to be a product of ordinary 2-Qbit controlled operators. If A = Z4X3Z2X1X0, then cA would be cZ4cX3cZ2cX1cX0, where each of the five terms has a different target Qbit, but all are controlled by one and the same ancilla.
If the ancilla is initially in the state |0⟩ and one applies a Hadamard transform H to the ancilla both before and after applying cA to the n + 1 Qbits and the initial state of the n Qbits is |⟩, then the n Qbits will end up entangled with the ancilla in the state

  The way in which measurement gates are
employed in quantum error correction. The ancilla (upper wire) is initially in the state zero. The remaining five Qbits are initially in the state |ψ⟩. If the measurement gate acting on the ancilla gives the result x (0 or 1) then the final state of the five Qbits will be the (renormalized) projection Px |ψ ⟩ of the initial state into the subspace spanned by the eigenstates of Z4X3Z2X1X0 with eigenvalue (−1)x .

If we now measure the ancilla, then according to the generalized Born rule, if the measurement gate indicates 0 or 1, then the state of the n Qbits becomes the (renormalized) projection of |⟩ into the subspace of positive (eigenvalue +1) or negative (eigenvalue −1) eigenstates of A. This is illustrated for the case A = Z4X3Z2X1X0 in Figure 5.6.
This procedure is called measuring A or a measurement of A. The terminology reflects the fact that it is a generalization of the ordinary process of measuring a single Qbit, to which it reduces when n = 1 and A = Z. In that case the subspaces spanned by the positive and negative eigenstates of Z are just the one-dimensional subspaces spanned by |0⟩ and |1⟩, and the probabilities of the two outcomes, as one can easily check, are indeed given by the Born rule.
In error correction one needs several such Hermitian operators, each squaring to unity, all acting on the same n Qbits. For concreteness consider the case of three such operators, A, B, and C. Introduce an ancillary Qbit for each operator, labeling the ancillas 0, 1, and 2, and introduce controlled operators cA, cB, and cC, each controlled by the corresponding ancilla. Now apply Hadamards to each of the ancillas (each initially taken to be in the state |0⟩), both before and after the product of all the controlled operators acts. The result (see Figure 5.7) is the obvious generalization of (5.23), taking |0⟩|0⟩|0⟩|⟩ into

The effect of measuring the three ancillas (top three wires) is to project the state of the n Qbits associated with the lower wire into its component in one of the eight eigenspaces of A, B, and C. If the results of measuring the control bits associated with A, B, and C are x0, x1, and x2 then the projection is into the eigenspace with eigenvalues (−1)x0 , (−1)x1 , and (−1)x2 . Such a process is called “measuring A, B, andC.”Whenn =3and A, B, and C are three different 1-Qbit Z operators, the process is equivalent to an ordinary measurement of the three Qbits on which the three Z operators act.

  So measurement of the three ancillas projects the n Qbits into one of the eight simultaneous eigenspaces of the three commuting operators C, B, and A, and the outcome x2 x1 x0 of the measurement determines which eigenspace it is. This process is described as a joint measurement ofC,B,andA.
Note that if A, B, and C are 1-Qbit operators Zi, Zj, and Zk that act on the i th, j th, and kth of the n Qbits, then this process reduces to the ordinary measurement of those three Qbits, since 12 (1 + (−1)x Z) projects onto the 1-Qbit state |x⟩. The two equivalent error-correction circuits in Figures 5.3 and 5.5 are measurements, in this generalized sense, of the two commuting operators A = Z2Z1 and B = Z1Z0.
The form (5.18) of a general 1-Qbit error on an n-Qbit codeword re- veals that to correct errors it is necessary to make a measurement, in this more general sense of the term, that projects a possibly corrupted code- word into an identifiable one of 1 + 3n orthogonal two-dimensional spaces: one two-dimensional subspace for the uncorrupted codeword |⟩, and 3n additional two-dimensional subspaces for each of the 1- QbiterrortermsXi|⟩,Yi|⟩,andZi|⟩,i =0,...,n−1,in(5.18). Thus the 2n -dimensional space spanned by all the states of the n Qbits must be large enough to contain 1 + 3n orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces, giving us the condition
2n−1 ≥ 3n + 1 (5.28)
on an n-Qbit code capable of correcting a general 1-Qbit error. The lowest n satisfying this condition is n = 5, for which it holds as an

5.5 THE 5-QBIT ERROR-CORRECTING CODE 117
 equality. Remarkably, there is indeed a 5-Qbit code for which this can be done. This is reminiscent of the situation in Section 5.2, where it was necessary only to discriminate between the uncorrupted codeword |⟩ and the n NOT-corruptions Xi |⟩. There the number of Qbits had to satisfy (5.5), which is first satisfied (again as an equality) when n = 3.
The 5-Qbit code is the most compact and elegant of the quantum error-correcting codes, but it suffers from the fact that it is difficult to construct the appropriate generalizations of 1- and 2-Qbit gates between codewords. I therefore go on to describe a second, 7-Qbit code, which overcomes this problem. The first quantum error-correcting code, discovered by Peter Shor, which uses a 9-Qbit generalization of the 3-Qbit code of Section 5.2, is now of solely historical interest. It is described in Appendix N.
5.5 The 5-Qbit error-correcting code
The two 5-Qbit code words |0⟩ and |1⟩ are most conveniently defined in terms of the very operators, described in general terms in Section 5.4, that will be used to diagnose the error syndrome. So we begin by specifying those operators.
To distinguish 1 + (3 × 5) = 16 mutually orthogonal two- dimensional subspaces we require four such mutually commuting Hermitian operators that square to unity, since each can independently have two eigenvalues (±1) and 24 = 16. These operators are defined as follows:
M =ZXXZ, 0 1234
M =ZXXZ, 1 2340
M =ZXXZ, 2 3401
M =ZXXZ. 3 4012
(5.29)
EachoftheMi squarestounitybecauseeachisaproductofcommut- ing operators that square to unity. To check that the Mi are mutually commuting,notethatalltheindividualXi andZj operatorscommute with one another except for an Xi and Zi with the same index, which anticommute: Xi Zi = −Zi Xi . But in converting the product of any two different Mi to the product in the reverse order by reversing the orders of the individual Xi and Zi operators that make them up, one always encounters exactly two interchanges that result in a minus sign.
One might be tempted to break the irritating asymmetry of (5.30) by adding to the list
M4 = Z0X1X2Z3, (5.30)

118 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION
 but it is not independent of the other four. Every Xi and Zi appears exactly twice in the product of all five Mi , so the product must be either 1 or −1. One easily checks that
and therefore
M0M1M2M3M4 = 1, (5.31) M4 = M0M1M2M3. (5.32)
The 5-Qbit codewords are most clearly and usefully defined in terms of the Mi (rather than writing out their lengthy explicit expansions in computational-basis states):
|0⟩ = 14 (1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)(1 + M3)|00000⟩,
(5.33) |1⟩ = 14 (1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)(1 + M3)|11111⟩.
Before examining how one might produce five Qbits in either of these states, we discuss how the states work to correct 1-Qbit errors.
Since each M flips two Qbits, |0⟩ is a superposition of computational-
basis states with an odd number of zeros (and an even number of ones),
while |1⟩ is a superposition of states with an odd number of ones (and
an even number of zeros). Consequently the two codeword states are
orthogonal. They are also normalized to unity. Since M2 = 1, i
(1+Mi)2 =2(1+Mi).
⟨0|0⟩ = ⟨00000|(1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)(1 + M3)|00000⟩,
(5.34)
So we have
(5.35) ⟨1|1⟩ = ⟨11111|(1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)(1 + M3)|11111⟩.
If we expand the products of 1 + Mi into 16 terms, the term 1 con-
tributes 1 to ⟨0|0⟩ and to ⟨1|1⟩. Each of the remaining 15 terms can
be reduced, using (5.31) (and the fact that each M2 = 1), to either a i
single Mi or a product of two (i = 0,...,4). So each of the 15 terms flips either two or four Qbits and contributes 0 to the inner products.
BecausetheMi allcommuteandbecause
Mi (1 + Mi ) = 1 + Mi , (5.36)
the states |0⟩, |1⟩, and their superpositions
|⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ (5.37)
arealleigenstatesofeachoftheMi witheigenvalue1.
The 15 possible corruptions of (5.37) appearing in the corrupted state (5.18) are also eigenstates of the Mi, distinguished by the

Note that each of the 15 columns, and the 16th column associated with 1 (no error), has a unique pattern of + and − signs.

  15 = 24 − 1 other possible sets of eigenvalues ±1 that the four Mi (i = 0,...,3) can have. To see this, note first that each Xi,Yi, and Zi commutes or anticommutes with all four Mi . Therefore each of the terms Xi |⟩, Yi |⟩, and Zi |⟩ appearing in (5.18) is indeed an eigenstateofeachMi witheigenvalue1or−1.
Table5.2indicateswhethereachMi commutes(+)oranticommutes (−) with each of the Xi , Yi , Zi , and (trivially) the unit operator 1. In- spection of the table reveals that each of the 16 possible binary columns of four symbols (+ or −) appears in exactly one column. Therefore, whenthefourMi aremeasured,thecorruptedstate(5.18)isprojected back to its original form if all four eigenvalues are +1, or projected onto one of the 15 corrupted states X0|⟩, . . ., Z4|⟩ depending on which column in the table describes the eigenvalues. In each corrupted case the original state can be restored by application of the corresponding unitary transformation Xi , −Yi = Xi Zi , or Zi to the appropriate Qbit. A circuit that measures the four operators (5.29) is shown in Figure 5.8.
The perfect efficiency of the 5-Qbit code leads to a straightfor- ward way to manufacture the two 5-Qbit codeword states (5.33). As noted above, the 16 distinct sets of eigenvalues for the four mutually commuting operators Mi decompose the 32-dimensional space of five Qbits into 16 mutually orthogonal two-dimensional sub- spaces, spanned by |0⟩ and |1⟩ and by each of their 15 pairs of 1-Qbit corruptions.
The two-fold degeneracy of the four Mi within each of these 16 subspaces is lifted by the operator
Z = Z0Z1Z2Z3Z4, (5.38)
which commutes with all the Mi . Since |00000⟩ and |11111⟩ are eigen- states of Z with eigenvalues 1 and −1, and since Z commutes with Zi ,

Z|1⟩ = −|1⟩, ZZi |1⟩ = −Zi |1⟩, ZXi |1⟩ = Xi |1⟩, ZYi |1⟩ = Yi |1⟩.
(5.39)
Consequently if one takes five Qbits in any state you like (perhaps mostconveniently|00000⟩)andmeasuresthefourMi togetherwithZ, one projects the Qbits into one of the 32 states
|0⟩, Xi |0⟩, Yi |0⟩, Zi |0⟩, |1⟩, Xi |1⟩, Yi |1⟩, Zi |1⟩, (5.40)
and learns from the results of the measurement which it is. Just as in the error-correction procedure, if the state is not |0⟩ or |1⟩ we can restore it to either of these forms by applying the appropriate Xi , Yi , or Zi . If we wish to initialize the five Qbits to |0⟩ we can apply X, where
X = X0X1X2X3X4, (5.41)
should the measurement indicate that the error-corrected state is |1⟩. This process of using a generalized measurement to produce five Qbits in the state |0⟩ is analogous to the procedure of using an ordinary measurement to produce a single Qbit in the state |0⟩ described in Section 1.10.
There is quite a different way to construct the 5-Qbit codewords, by applying a set of 1- and 2-Qbit unitary gates to an uncoded 1-Qbit state and four ancillary Qbits all initially in the state |0⟩. This is described in Section 5.9.

The 5-Qbit code is theoretically ideal but suffers from the problem that circuits performing extensions of many of the basic 1- and 2- Qbit operations to the 5-Qbit codewords are cumbersome. The current favorite is a 7-Qbit code, devised by Andrew Steane, which permits implementations of many basic operations on codewords, which are not only quite simple but also themselves susceptible to error correction.
The Steane code uses six mutually commuting operators to diagnose the error syndrome:
M =XXXX, N =ZZZZ, 0 0456 0 0456
The six operators in (5.42) clearly square to give the unit operator. The Mi trivially commute among themselves as do the Ni , and each Mi commutes with each N j , in spite of the anticommutation of each Xk with the corresponding Zk, because in every case they share an even number of such pairs. A circuit that measures the six operators (5.42) is shown in Figure 5.9.

We again defer our discussion of how to produce these states until after our discussion of how they are used in error correction.
The two states in (5.43) are orthogonal, since each M flips four Qbits while X flips all seven of them, so the first state is a superposition of 7-Qbit states with an odd number of zeros while the second is a superposition with an even number of zeros. They are normalized to unity, for essentially the same reasons as in the case of 5-Qbit code.
Since X commutes with all the Mi , a general superposition of the two codewords can be written as

In the same way, the signature of a Zi error (or no error) is that all threeNi measurementsgive+1andthenthepatternof−1eigenvalues in the Mi measurements determines which of the seven possible Zi characterize the error.
Finally, the signature of a Yi error is that at least some of both the Mi and the Ni measurements give −1. The resulting pattern of −1 eigenvalues (which will be the same for both the Mi and the Ni mea- surements)thendetermineswhichofthesevenpossibleYi characterize the error.
So the six measurements project the corrupted state into a unique one of the 22 terms in (5.47) and establish which term it is. One can then undo the corruption by applying the appropriate one of the 22 operators 1, X0, . . ., Z6.
To produce the 7-Qbit codewords one cannot immediately extend the method we used in Section 5.5 to produce the 5-Qbit codewords, because the two 7-Qbit codewords and their 21 1-Qbit corruptions constitute only 44 mutually orthogonal states, while the space of seven Qbits has dimension 27 = 128. One can, however, provide the missing 84 dimensions by noting the following.
The 2 × 7 × 6 = 84 states given by
XiZj|0⟩ and XiZj|1⟩, i ̸= j, (5.48)
are also easily verified to be eigenstates of all the Mi and Ni . These states can be associated with some of the possible 2-Qbit errors, but this is not pertinent to the use to which we put them here. Like the 1-QbitYi errors,thesestatesresultinatleastsomeofboththeMi and

This gets us back to the situation we encountered in the 5-Qbit case. By measuring the seven mutually commuting operators Mi , Ni , and
Z = Z0Z1Z2Z3Z4Z5Z6, (5.49)
we can produce from seven Qbits in an arbitrarily chosen state a unique one of the 128 mutually orthogonal states given by |0⟩, |1⟩, their 42 different 1-Qbit corruptions, and their 84 different special kinds of 2-Qbit corruptions. The results of the measurement tell us the char- acter (if any) of the corruption, from which we know what operators (Xi,Yi,Zi, or XiZj, possibly combined with X) we must apply to the post-measurement state to convert it into |0⟩.
A simpler way to produce 7-Qbit codewords is to start with seven Qbits in the standard initial state |0⟩7, and then measure M0, M1, and M2. The resulting state will be one of the eight states
2−3/2(1 ± M0)(1 ± M1)(1 ± M2)|0⟩7, (5.50)
with the specific pattern of + and − signs being revealed by the mea- surement. The upper part of Table 5.3 now permits one to choose a uniqueZi thatcommutesoranticommuteswitheachMi dependingon whether it appears in (5.50) with a + or a − sign. Since Zi |0⟩7 = |0⟩7, actingonthesevenQbitswiththatparticularZi convertstheirstateto
2−3/2(1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)|0⟩7 = |0⟩. (5.51)
In Section 5.8 we examine a surprisingly simple circuit that encodes a general 1-Qbit state into a 7-Qbit codeword state in the manner of Figure 5.1, without using any measurement gates.
5.7 Operations on 7-Qbit codewords
The virtue of the 7-Qbit code, that makes it preferable to the 5-Qbit code in spite of its greater expenditure of Qbits, is that many of the fundamental 1- and 2-Qbit gates are trivially extended to 7- and 14- Qbit gates acting on the codewords. Because, for example, X commutes with the Mi and flips all seven Qbits, it implements the logical NOT on the codewords (5.43):
X|0⟩ = |1⟩, X|1⟩ = |0⟩. (5.52) Similarly, Z commutes with the Mi , anticommutes with X, and leaves
|0⟩7 invariant, so it implements the logical Z on the codewords:
Z|0⟩ = |0⟩, Z|1⟩ = −|1⟩. (5.53)

5.7 OPERATIONS ON 7-QBIT CODEWORDS 125
 This much works equally well for the 5-Qbit code. More remarkably, for the 7-Qbit code the bitwise Hadamard transformation,
H = H0H1H2H3H4H5H6, (5.54) also implements the logical Hadamard transformation on the code-
words:
H|0⟩= √1 |0⟩+|1⟩ , H|1⟩= √1 |0⟩−|1⟩ . (5.55) 22
(This does not hold for the 5-Qbit code.)
To see this, note first that two normalized states |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ are
identical if and only if their inner product is 1. (For one can always express |ψ⟩ in the form |ψ⟩ = α|φ⟩ + β|χ⟩, where |χ⟩ is orthogonal to|φ⟩and|α|2 +|β|2 =1.Wethenhave⟨φ|ψ⟩=α,soif⟨φ|ψ⟩=1, then α = 1 and β = 0.) Since |0⟩ and |1⟩ are normalized and orthogonal and since H is unitary and therefore preserves the normalization of |0⟩ and |1⟩, the four states appearing in the two equalities in (5.55) are all normalized. Therefore, to establish those equalities it suffices to show that
1 = √1 ⟨0|H|0⟩ + ⟨0|H|1⟩ , 1 = √1 ⟨1|H|0⟩ − ⟨1|H|1⟩ . 22
(5.56) This in turn would follow if we could show that the matrix of the encoded Hadamard in the encoded states is the same as the matrix of
the 1-Qbit Hadamard in the 1-Qbit states:
⟨0|H|0⟩ = ⟨0|H|1⟩ = ⟨1|H|0⟩ = √1 , ⟨1|H|1⟩ = −√1 . (5.57) 22
To establish (5.57), note that it follows from the definition (5.43) of the codewords |0⟩ and |1⟩ that the four matrix elements appearing in (5.57) are
⟨x|H|y⟩ = 2−3 7⟨0|Xx(1 + M0)(1 + M1)(1 + M2)H(1 + M0)
× (1 + M1)(1 + M2)Xy|0⟩7. (5.58)
Since HX = ZH and XH = HZ, and since each Ni differs from Mi only by the replacement of each X by the corresponding Z, it follows that
HMi =Ni H, Mi H=HNi. (5.59)
Sowecanbringallthreeterms1+Mi in(5.58)ontherightofHover to the left if we replace each by 1 + Ni . But since the Ms and Ns all commute we can then bring all three terms 1 + Mi on the left of H over to the right if we again replace each by 1 + Ni . The effect of these interchanges is simply to change all the Ms in (5.58) into Ns:
⟨x|H|y⟩ = 2−3 7⟨0|Xx(1 + N0)(1 + N1)(1 + N2)H(1 + N0)
× (1 + N1)(1 + N2)Xy|0⟩7. (5.60)

126 QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION
 Since each Ni commutes with X (there are four anticommutations) we have
⟨x|H|y⟩ = 2−3 7⟨0|(1 + N0)(1 + N1)(1 + N2)Xx H Xy(1 + N0)
× (1 + N1)(1 + N2)|0⟩7, (5.61)
butsinceeachNi actsastheidentityon|0⟩7,eachofthesix1+Ni can be replaced by a factor of 2, reducing (5.61) simply to
⟨x|H|y⟩ = 23 7⟨0|Xx H Xy|0⟩7. (5.62) Since X, H, and |0⟩7 are tensor products of the seven 1-Qbit quantities
X, H, and |0⟩, (5.62) is just
⟨x|H|y⟩ = 23 ⟨x|H|y⟩7. (5.63)
But since
⟨0|H|0⟩ = ⟨0|H|1⟩ = ⟨1|H|0⟩ = √1 , ⟨1|H|1⟩ = −√1 , (5.64) 22
(5.63) does indeed reduce to (5.57), establishing that H = H⊗7 does indeed act as a logical Hadamard gate on the codewords.
Nor is it difficult to make a 14-Qbit logical cNOT gate that takes the pair of codewords |x⟩|y⟩ into |x⟩|x ⊕ y⟩. One simply applies ordinary cNOT gates to each of the seven pairs of corresponding Qbits in the two codewords. This works because each of the codewords in (5.43) is left invariant by each of the Mi . If the control codeword is in the state |0⟩ then the pattern of flips applied to the target codeword for each of the eight terms in the expansion of the control codeword
|0⟩=2−3/2 1+M0 +M1 +M2 +M1M2 +M2M0 +M0M1+M0M1M2 |0⟩7 (5.65)
issimplygivenbythecorrespondingproductofMi.SinceeachMi acts as the identity on both |0⟩ and |1⟩, the target codeword is unchanged. On the other hand, if the control codeword is in the state |1⟩ then the pattern of flips applied to the target codeword differs from this by an additional application of X, which has precisely the effect of interchanging |0⟩ and |1⟩.
Because of the simplicity of all these encoded gates, one can use error correction to eliminate malfunctions of the elementary gates themselves, if the rate of malfunctioning is so low that only a sin- gle one of the seven elementary gates is likely to malfunction. In the case of the 1-Qbit encoded gates, their elementary components act only on single Qbits in the codeword, so if only a single one of them mal- functions then only a single Qbit in the codeword will be corrupted and the error-correction procedure described above will restore the correct output. But this works as well for the encoded cNOT gate, since if only a single one of the elementary 2-Qbit cNOT gates malfunctions,

 this will affect only single Qbits in each of the two encoded 7-Qbit words, and the correct output will again be restored by applying error correction to both of the codewords.
Another virtue of codeword gates that can be constructed as ten- sor products of uncoded gates is that they cannot (when functioning correctly) convert single-Qbit errors to multiple-Qbit errors, as more elaborate constructions of codeword gates might do. This highly de- sirable property is called fault tolerance. The great advantage of the 7-Qbit code is that many of the most important logical gates can be implemented in a fault-tolerant way.
5.8 A 7-Qbit encoding circuit
The circuit in Figure 5.10 encodes a general 1-Qbit state into a 7-Qbit codeword without using any measurement gates, in a manner analogous to the way Figure 5.1 produces 3-Qbit codewords.
Since the circuit is unitary and therefore linear, it is enough to show that it works when |ψ⟩ = |0⟩ and when |ψ⟩ = |1⟩. This follows from the fact that if the (n + 1)-Qbit gate CU is a controlled n-Qbit unitary U, then
CU H|0⟩ ⊗|⟩n =CU√1 |0⟩+|1⟩ ⊗|⟩n 2
= √1 1+X⊗U |0⟩⊗|⟩n, (5.66) 2
where the control Qbit is on the left. If this is applied to the three controlled triple-NOT gates in Figure 5.10 then, reading from

left to right, the resulting operations are (1/ 2)(1 + X2X3X4X6) =

√√
(1/ 2)(1 + X0X4X5X6) = (1/ 2)(1 + M0).
When |ψ⟩ = |0⟩ the controlled double-NOT on the left acts as the identity, so the circuit does indeed produce the codeword |0⟩ in (5.43). When |ψ⟩ = |1⟩, the controlled double-NOT on the left acts as X4X5. The circuit after that action is exactly the same as when |ψ⟩ = |0⟩, except that the initial state of Qbits 3, 4, and 5 on the left is |1⟩ rather than |0⟩. Since all Xi commute, the state that results is not |0⟩ but X3X4X5|0⟩. But
X3X4X5 = X0X1X2X3X4X5X6M0M1M2 = XM0M1M2. (5.67)
Since M0M1M2 acts as the identity on |0⟩, the resulting state is indeed |1⟩ = X|0⟩.
A less direct method to confirm that Figure 5.10 produces the 7- Qbit encoding, analogous to the method described in Section 5.9 for the 5-Qbit encoding, is given in Appendix O.
5.9 A 5-Qbit encoding circuit
The circuit in Figure 5.11 encodes a general 1-Qbit state into a 5-Qbit codeword without using any measurement gates.
The circuit differs from one reported by David DiVincenzo2 only by the presence of the 1-Qbit gates ZHZ on the left. When |ψ⟩ = |x⟩ DiVincenzo’s circuit produces two orthogonal linear combinations of the codewords (5.43), which are, of course, equally valid choices. But to get the codewords in (5.43) one needs these additional gates. (I have written them in the symmetric form ZHZ rather than in the simpler equivalent form YH both to spare the reader from having to remember that Y = ZX and not XZ, and also to spare her the confusion of having to reverse the order of gates when going from a circuit diagram to the corresponding equation.)
In contrast to the superficially similar circuit for the 7-Qbit code in Figure 5.10, there does not seem to be a transparently simple way to demonstrate that the circuit in Figure 5.11 does produce the 5-Qbit codewords. One can always, of course, write down the action of each successive gate in the circuit, and check that the resulting unwieldy expressions are identical to the explicit expansions of the codewords (5.33) in computational-basis states. A less clumsy proof follows from the fact that |0⟩ is the unique (to within an overall phase factor eiφ) joint eigenvector with all eigenvalues 1 of the five mutually commuting operators consisting of the four error-syndrome operators M0, . . ., M3

  A 5-Qbit encoding circuit. If the initial state of the Qbit on the top wire is |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, then the circuit produces the corresponding superposition of the two 5-Qbit codewords given in (5.33), |⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩. This fact is established in Figures 5.12–5.20. The figure illustrates this for the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ (x = 0 or 1) on the upper wire. Since a product of unitary gates is linear, the circuit encodes arbitrary superpositions of these states.
  of Equation (5.29) and the operator Z of Equation (5.38). So if we can establish that the state |x⟩ produced in Figure 5.11 is invariant under the four Mi , that it is invariant under Z when x = 0, and that applying the 5-Qbit X to |x⟩ is the same as applying the 1-Qbit X to |x⟩, then we will have shown that the circuit produces the 5-Qbit encoding to within an overall phase factor e i φ . Having done this, we can then confirm that eiφ = 1 by evaluating the projection on |0⟩5 of the state produced by the circuit when x = 0.
To learn the actions of various products of 1-Qbit Xs and Zs on the state produced by the circuit in Figure 5.11, we apply them on the right side of the diagram, and then bring them to the left through the cNOT gates and 1-Qbit gates that make up the circuit, until they act directly on the input state on the left. In doing this we must use the fact that bringing an X (or a Z) through a Hadamard converts it to a Z (or an X), bringing an X through a Z introduces a factor of −1, and bringing an X or a Z through a cNOT has the results shown in Figure 5.12: a Z on the control Qbit (or an X on the target Qbit) commutes with a cNOT, while bringing a Z through the target Qbit (or an X through the control Qbit) introduces an additional Z on the control Qbit (or X on the target Qbit).
Figure 5.13 uses these elementary facts to show that M0 = Z1X2X3Z4 leaves both codewords invariant, by demonstrating that it can be brought to the left through all the gates in the circuit to act on the input state |x0000⟩ as Z2. Figures 5.14–5.16 show similar things for M1 = Z2X3X4Z0, M2 = Z3X4X0Z1, and M3 = Z4X0X1Z2, which can be brought to the left through all the gates to act on the input state as Z0, Z3, and Z1. Figure 5.17 shows that X = X0X1X2X3X4 can be brought to the left through all the gates of the circuit to act on the input state |x0000⟩ as X4Z2Z1, which simply interchanges x = 0 and

  x = 1, thereby demonstrating that X acts as logical X on the codewords. Figure 5.18 shows the analogous property for Z = Z0Z1Z2Z3Z4, which can be brought to the left through all the gates of the circuit to act on the input state |x0000⟩ as Z4Z3Z0, which multiplies it by (−1)x, thereby demonstrating that Z acts as logical Z on the codewords. Finally Fig- ures 5.19 and 5.20 show that the inner product of the codeword state |0⟩ with the computational-basis state |00000⟩ is 14 , thereby demonstrating that the circuit produces the codewords (5.33) with the right phase.
In Appendix O this circuit-theoretic approach is used to give a sec- ond (more complicated, but instructive) demonstration of the validity of the 7-Qbit encoding circuit of Figure 5.10.

(a) Z4 and X3 are changed to X4 and Z3 as a result of having been brought through Hadamard gates.

The encoding circuits for 5-Qbit and 7-Qbit codewords as outlined in your provided figures demonstrate complex transformations from a single qubit state into a multi-qubit codeword through a series of quantum gates. These circuits utilize controlled-NOT gates, Hadamard gates, and other operations to entangle multiple qubits, ensuring the encoded state can withstand certain types of errors and be corrected if an error is detected.

For the 5-Qbit encoding, the process involves initially preparing the qubits in a specific state, then applying a sequence of gates that effectively distributes the information of the single qubit across five qubits in a way that preserves the quantum information against specific error types. The circuit's construction takes into account the properties of quantum mechanics, such as entanglement and superposition, to ensure that the encoded state is both a valid representation of the original qubit and capable of being error-corrected.

Similarly, the 7-Qbit encoding circuit uses a combination of quantum gates to spread the quantum information of a single qubit across seven qubits. This encoding is designed to protect against a broader range of errors while maintaining the ability to perform quantum computations. The 7-Qbit code's advantage lies in its ability to implement logical operations on codewords in a fault-tolerant manner, meaning that even if some of the physical qubits are subjected to errors, the overall computation can still proceed correctly.

Both encoding schemes are central to the field of quantum error correction, a crucial area of research for building reliable quantum computers. Error correction codes like these allow quantum information to be preserved over time and through computational operations, despite the inherently fragile nature of quantum states and their susceptibility to decoherence and other error sources.

The concept of quantum error correction is pivotal for the feasibility and advancement of quantum computing. At its core, quantum error correction addresses a seemingly paradoxical challenge: the need to detect and correct errors in a quantum system without directly measuring and thus disturbing the delicate quantum states that carry information. This challenge arises because quantum measurements, by their very nature, tend to alter the state of the system being measured, potentially erasing the information one aims to preserve.

Quantum error correction reveals that it is indeed possible to identify and correct errors in quantum systems through ingeniously designed quantum codes. These codes operate by encoding the quantum information across multiple qubits in such a way that, even if some qubits undergo errors due to interactions with the environment or other factors, the original information can be accurately retrieved without directly measuring the quantum state of any single qubit. This process leverages the principles of superposition and entanglement to spread the information in a manner that allows for the indirect inference of errors and their subsequent correction.

The realization that quantum error correction was possible marked a significant milestone in quantum computing. It transformed the field from a theoretical curiosity into a practical pursuit by showing that quantum computers could, in principle, operate reliably despite the inherent fragility of quantum states. This opened up new horizons for quantum computing, making it a tangible goal rather than an unattainable dream.

Furthermore, quantum error correction is not merely a technical workaround; it is a profound illustration of the unique principles of quantum mechanics being harnessed to solve problems that are insurmountable in classical systems. The discovery and development of quantum error correction codes have enriched our understanding of quantum mechanics and have laid the groundwork for the ongoing development of robust quantum computers capable of solving complex problems beyond the reach of classical computing.

The discussion centers on illustrating the principles of quantum error correction through a basic but powerful example. Here, quantum bits (qubits) are subject to errors that can flip their state from |0⟩ to |1⟩ or vice versa. The section outlines a method to encode a single qubit's state into a more complex state spread across multiple qubits, enhancing the system's resilience to errors.

The model introduces a quantum error correction code that enables the detection and correction of these bit-flip errors without directly measuring the fragile quantum state of any individual qubit. This is achieved through a clever arrangement of quantum gates that effectively diagnose the presence of errors by examining the overall state of the system. The process is carefully designed to avoid the direct measurement of qubits, preserving their quantum superposition and entanglement properties.

By focusing on this simplified scenario, the section provides an accessible introduction to the concept of quantum error correction. It showcases how encoding, along with non-destructive error detection and correction techniques, can be employed to protect quantum information against specific types of errors. This example lays the groundwork for understanding more complex error correction schemes and demonstrates the fundamental strategies used to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing.

The model presents a sophisticated approach to quantum error correction, specifically tailored to address bit-flip errors, which are analogous to flipping a bit from 0 to 1 or vice versa in classical computing. This quantum error correction code is ingeniously crafted to allow for the detection and rectification of such errors without necessitating the direct measurement of the quantum state of individual qubits. The fundamental challenge it overcomes is the inherently disruptive nature of quantum measurements, which can collapse the quantum state, thereby eradicating the very superpositions and entanglements that quantum computing leverages for its computational power.

The solution employs a strategic configuration of quantum gates that work in concert to monitor the integrity of the system's overall state. By encoding a single logical qubit's information across multiple physical qubits, the system introduces redundancy in a way that uniquely quantum properties can exploit. This redundancy allows for the collective state of the encoded qubits to be interrogated, revealing any discrepancies indicative of a bit-flip error.

The detection mechanism hinges on an indirect measurement strategy, utilizing ancillary qubits (or ancillas) that interact with the system through a series of controlled quantum gate operations. These operations are designed to correlate the ancillas' states with the possible error states of the system without collapsing the superpositions of the qubits encoding the logical information. After the interaction, measuring the state of the ancillas yields information about the error status of the system. Importantly, this measurement does not disturb the quantum state of the logical qubits, thus preserving the essential quantum properties of superposition and entanglement.

If an error is detected, the system employs a corrective sequence of quantum gates, determined by the outcome of the ancilla measurements. This sequence is precisely tailored to reverse the effect of a bit-flip error on the system, restoring the original quantum state of the logical qubit. The elegance of this method lies in its ability to correct errors through a well-orchestrated interplay of quantum gate operations that ensure the system's resilience to specific types of disruptions.

This model of quantum error correction serves as a foundational example of how quantum information can be protected and reliably manipulated. It illustrates the principle that, through clever encoding and the judicious use of quantum gates, it is possible to detect and correct errors in a quantum system without directly observing the fragile quantum states of individual qubits. This approach maintains the coherence and entanglement necessary for quantum computing, paving the way for more complex and robust error correction schemes essential for the realization of practical quantum computing.

5.3 The Physics of Error Generation: This section delves into the mechanisms through which errors are introduced into quantum systems, highlighting the significant role of unintended interactions between qubits and their external environment. Such interactions lead to decoherence, a process that disrupts the coherent quantum states crucial for computation. The disruption is not limited to simple bit-flips; it extends to more complex errors, including phase shifts and combinations thereof, which can continuously evolve and thus alter the quantum state.

The mathematical framework for describing these interactions and their resultant errors involves considering the quantum system (qubits) in interaction with its environment. This can be mathematically represented as an evolution of the system's state, $|\psi\rangle$, in the presence of an environment state, $|e\rangle$, leading to an entangled state of the system and environment. A general interaction might transform an initial state $|\psi\rangle \otimes |e\rangle$ (the tensor product of the system's and environment's initial states) into a corrupted state through a unitary evolution $U$, reflecting the combined effects of the system-environment interaction. 

Errors manifest in various forms, such as bit-flips ($X$), phase shifts ($Z$), and their combinations ($Y = iXZ$), where $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ are Pauli matrices representing quantum bit-flip, bit-and-phase flip, and phase flip operations, respectively. These errors can be described using the notation:

$$
|\psi_{\text{error}}\rangle = U(|\psi\rangle \otimes |e\rangle) = a|e_0\rangle \otimes |\psi\rangle + b|e_1\rangle \otimes X|\psi\rangle + c|e_2\rangle \otimes Z|\psi\rangle + d|e_3\rangle \otimes Y|\psi\rangle
$$

where $|e_0\rangle, |e_1\rangle, |e_2\rangle,$ and $|e_3\rangle$ are states of the environment post-interaction, and $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are coefficients representing the probability amplitudes for the system to be in the corresponding state. This representation showcases how the quantum system's state can evolve into a superposition of its original and error-affected states due to interaction with the environment.

The section further introduces the concept of quantum error correction codes, designed to identify and correct such errors without directly measuring the fragile quantum states of individual qubits. By entangling qubits in a way that the overall state of the system encodes the original quantum information redundantly, these codes allow for the detection and correction of errors by examining the collective properties of the system. This approach leverages the non-classical correlations (entanglement) among qubits to preserve the integrity of quantum information, laying the groundwork for robust quantum computation despite the inevitability of environmental interactions.

5.4 Diagnosing Error Syndromes: This section focuses on the strategies for identifying errors within quantum systems by introducing the concept of error syndromes. Error syndromes are essentially patterns or signatures of errors that can be detected without directly measuring the quantum state, thus avoiding the collapse of quantum superpositions. The detection of these syndromes is crucial for quantum error correction, as it allows for the identification of specific errors that have occurred within the system without disturbing the quantum information encoded in the qubits.

The process of diagnosing error syndromes involves the use of ancillary qubits (also known as ancilla or helper qubits) and a series of quantum gates that perform controlled operations on the qubits of interest. These operations are designed to entangle the ancilla qubits with the computational qubits in such a way that any errors in the computational qubits lead to observable outcomes in the ancilla qubits. By measuring the state of the ancilla qubits, one can infer the presence and type of error in the computational qubits based on the predefined syndromes.

For example, consider a simple error syndrome measurement for a bit-flip error in a three-qubit code. Two ancilla qubits are prepared in the $|0\rangle$ state and then entangled with the computational qubits through controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. The CNOT gates are arranged in a way that if a bit-flip error occurs in any of the computational qubits, the resulting state of the ancilla qubits will change from $|00\rangle$ to $|01\rangle$, $|10\rangle$, or $|11\rangle$, depending on which qubit was affected. By measuring the ancilla qubits, one can determine which, if any, of the computational qubits experienced a bit-flip error.

Mathematically, the syndrome measurement can be represented as follows: suppose the computational qubits are initially in a state $|\psi\rangle$ and an error $E$ occurs, transforming the state into $E|\psi\rangle$. Ancilla qubits are then entangled with the computational qubits using a unitary operation $U_{\text{entangle}}$, resulting in a state $U_{\text{entangle}}(E|\psi\rangle \otimes |00\rangle_{\text{ancilla}})$. The measurement of the ancilla qubits yields a syndrome $s$, which directly correlates to the error $E$.

The syndrome measurement procedure is a powerful tool in quantum error correction, as it provides a way to detect errors without collapsing the quantum state of the system. Once the error syndrome is known, appropriate correction operations can be applied to restore the original quantum state, thus ensuring the integrity of quantum information processing.

### Message 85 (Assistant)
*2024-02-17 15:35:40*

5.5 The 5-Qubit Error-Correcting Code: This section introduces a more advanced quantum error correction code, known as the 5-qubit code, which represents a significant step forward in quantum error correction technology. The 5-qubit code is one of the smallest quantum codes that can correct any single-qubit error, including bit-flip, phase-flip, or a combination thereof. This capability is crucial for robust quantum computation, as it allows for the correction of the most common types of errors that can occur in quantum systems.

The 5-qubit code works by encoding 1 logical qubit of information into a highly entangled state of 5 physical qubits. This encoding spreads the information of the logical qubit across the 5 physical qubits in such a way that the loss or corruption of any single physical qubit can be detected and corrected without losing the information of the logical qubit.

The code utilizes a specific set of quantum gates to entangle the qubits and to create the encoded state. The entanglement pattern is carefully designed so that any single-qubit error results in a unique and detectable change in the state of the system, which can be identified without measuring the qubits directly. This is achieved through syndrome measurements, similar to those described in the earlier section, but tailored to the specific entanglement properties and error detection needs of the 5-qubit code.

Mathematically, the 5-qubit code can be described by its stabilizers. Stabilizers are operators that leave the encoded state unchanged and are used to detect errors. For the 5-qubit code, there are four independent stabilizers, each involving all five qubits. These stabilizers are carefully chosen to ensure that any single-qubit error will anticommute with exactly one of the stabilizers, leading to a detectable syndrome that indicates the presence and type of error.

For example, one of the stabilizers might be $X_1X_2X_3X_4X_5$, where $X_i$ denotes a Pauli-X (bit-flip) operation on the $i$th qubit. If a bit-flip error occurs on any one qubit, the measurement of this stabilizer will yield a result of -1, indicating an error, as opposed to +1 for the error-free state. Similar stabilizers are defined for detecting phase-flip errors and their combinations.

Once an error is detected through the measurement of the stabilizers, a correction operation is applied. This operation is determined based on the syndrome measured and is designed to reverse the error, restoring the original encoded state. The beauty of the 5-qubit code lies in its ability to correct any single-qubit error with just five qubits, making it a highly efficient and powerful tool for protecting quantum information against errors.

The development and understanding of the 5-qubit error-correcting code mark a critical milestone in quantum computing, demonstrating the feasibility of preserving quantum information over time, even in the face of errors. This capability is essential for the realization of practical and reliable quantum computers, capable of solving complex problems beyond the reach of classical computers.

5.6 The 7-Qubit Error-Correcting Code: This section delves into the Steane code, a sophisticated quantum error correction scheme that employs 7 qubits to encode a single logical qubit of information. The 7-qubit code, also known as the CSS (Calderbank-Shor-Steane) code, is notable for its fault-tolerant properties and the capacity to perform logical quantum operations directly on the encoded qubits without decoding them. This capability is critical for practical quantum computation, as it minimizes the operations that can introduce errors.

The Steane code is constructed from classical error-correcting codes in a way that allows it to correct both bit-flip ($X$) and phase-flip ($Z$) errors on any of the seven qubits. It leverages the properties of classical Hamming codes, which are capable of correcting single-bit errors in a block of seven bits, translating this capability into the quantum domain. The code's structure enables the detection of both types of quantum errors through a clever arrangement of syndrome measurements that do not disturb the quantum state of the logical qubit.

Mathematically, the Steane code is described by a set of stabilizer generators. These generators consist of four operators that detect bit-flip errors and another three that detect phase-flip errors. For instance, a bit-flip error detector might involve operations such as $X_1X_2X_3X_4$ (affecting the first four qubits), while a phase-flip error detector could involve $Z_1Z_2Z_5Z_6$. These stabilizers are chosen so that any single-qubit error will change the outcome of one or more syndrome measurements, revealing the presence and location of the error.

One of the remarkable features of the Steane code is its fault tolerance. Fault tolerance refers to the code's ability to handle errors not just in the qubits themselves but also in the operations used to detect and correct those errors. The arrangement and redundancy of the syndrome measurements ensure that a single error in the measurement process does not lead to a misdiagnosis of the error state or corrupt the encoded information. This is a crucial aspect for building scalable quantum computers, as it allows for the reliable operation of quantum circuits over extended periods, even in the presence of inevitable errors.

Moreover, the Steane code enables certain quantum gates to be performed directly on the encoded state without needing to decode it first. This property, known as transversal gate implementation, significantly reduces the risk of introducing errors during computation. Logical operations, such as the Hadamard, Phase, and $CNOT$ gates, can be applied transversally, meaning that the operation is applied independently to each of the physical qubits. This method preserves the code's ability to detect and correct errors, ensuring the integrity of the quantum information.

In conclusion, the 7-qubit Steane code represents a significant advancement in quantum error correction. Its ability to correct all single-qubit errors, combined with its fault-tolerant properties and the capacity for transversal logical operations, makes it a cornerstone in the quest for reliable and scalable quantum computing. The development and understanding of such codes are vital for realizing the full potential of quantum technology, enabling complex computations that are beyond the reach of classical computers while ensuring the robustness and accuracy of the results.

5.7 Operations on 7-Qubit Codewords: This section delves into the intricate process of executing logical operations on codewords within the framework of the 7-qubit error-correcting code, emphasizing the importance of fault tolerance in these operations. The fault-tolerant nature of these operations is crucial for practical quantum computing, as it ensures that the operations themselves do not introduce additional errors into the system or exacerbate existing ones.

Logical operations on 7-qubit codewords are designed to manipulate the encoded quantum information without needing to decode it. This approach is essential for maintaining the coherence and integrity of the quantum state throughout the computation process. The operations are implemented in such a way that they inherently detect and correct errors, thereby preserving the fault tolerance of the quantum error correction code.

### Fault-Tolerant Gate Implementation

The implementation of logical gates in a fault-tolerant manner is achieved through a technique known as transversal gate application. Transversal gates involve applying the same operation simultaneously to corresponding qubits in different blocks or, in this case, across the seven qubits of a single encoded block. This approach ensures that errors do not spread uncontrollably among qubits within a codeword or between different codewords.

For instance, to apply a logical NOT gate (which flips the state of a qubit) to an encoded qubit, the operation would be applied individually to each of the seven physical qubits in the codeword. Since the 7-qubit code is capable of correcting any single-qubit error, the transversal application of gates does not lead to error propagation that would exceed the code's correction capability.

### Logical Gates and Error Correction

Specific logical operations are compatible with the 7-qubit error correction code, including the Hadamard gate, the Phase gate, and the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. The Hadamard gate, which creates superpositions, can be applied transversally and still allows for error detection and correction. Similarly, the Phase gate, which adjusts the phase of the quantum state, and the CNOT gate, used for entangling two qubits, can be implemented in a manner that maintains the fault tolerance of the system.

The ability to perform these gates transversally is a key feature of the 7-qubit code, as it enables complex quantum algorithms to be executed on encoded information directly. This direct manipulation of encoded data minimizes the need for decoding and re-encoding around each operation, significantly reducing the potential for errors to occur during these processes.

### Ensuring Fault Tolerance

The fault tolerance of operations on 7-qubit codewords extends beyond the transversal application of gates. It also involves carefully designed error detection and correction cycles that are integrated into the computational process. After each logical operation, the system can perform a syndrome measurement to detect and correct any errors that may have arisen, ensuring that the quantum information remains intact.

Moreover, the design of quantum circuits for these operations takes into account the possibility of errors in the gates and measurement processes themselves. By using redundant encoding and ancillary qubits for syndrome measurements, the system can identify and correct errors without jeopardizing the encoded information.

In summary, operations on 7-qubit codewords represent a sophisticated blend of quantum error correction principles and fault-tolerant computing strategies. These operations enable reliable quantum computation by allowing direct manipulation of encoded quantum information in a way that automatically addresses errors. This capability is essential for advancing towards practical and scalable quantum computing, where maintaining the integrity of quantum information over long computational sequences is paramount.

It highlights the challenges and strategies for embedding error correction into quantum computational workflows, particularly focusing on the adaptability of error-correcting codes to various quantum algorithm requirements.

### Error Correction in Quantum Algorithms

Quantum algorithms leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to solve problems more efficiently than classical algorithms in certain cases. The implementation of these algorithms in a practical quantum computing environment necessitates the inclusion of error correction mechanisms to combat decoherence and operational errors that can degrade the quantum state.

The section discusses the seamless integration of error correction codes, like the 7-qubit code, into the execution of quantum algorithms. This integration is vital for maintaining the integrity of quantum information throughout the computational process, ensuring that the algorithms produce accurate results despite the inherent noise in quantum systems.

### Strategies for Error Correction Integration

The incorporation of error correction into quantum algorithms involves several strategies, including:
- **Encoding Algorithmic Qubits**: Quantum information required for the algorithm is encoded using error-correcting codes before computation begins. This encoding protects the information against errors without significantly altering the algorithm's logic.
- **Fault-Tolerant Gate Operations**: Logical operations required by the algorithm are performed in a fault-tolerant manner, using techniques such as transversal gates, which apply operations across encoded qubits in a way that inherently corrects errors.
- **Syndrome Measurement and Correction**: Throughout the algorithmic process, syndrome measurements are periodically performed to detect and correct errors in real-time, ensuring the fidelity of the quantum state.
- **Decoding for Measurement**: At the algorithm's conclusion, the encoded quantum information may be decoded for final measurement. This step involves carefully designed procedures to correct any remaining errors before decoding, ensuring the accuracy of the algorithm's output.

### Challenges and Solutions

Executing quantum algorithms with embedded error correction presents several challenges, including the increased resource requirements for encoding and correcting quantum information and the complexity of designing fault-tolerant logical operations that align with the specific needs of different algorithms.

Solutions to these challenges involve optimizing error correction codes for specific algorithmic tasks, developing efficient encoding and decoding techniques, and creating a library of fault-tolerant gates tailored to support a wide range of quantum algorithms. Additionally, ongoing research in quantum error correction seeks to reduce the overhead associated with error-corrected quantum computing, making it more practical for complex algorithmic implementations.

### Conclusion

Implementing quantum algorithms with error correction is a critical step towards realizing practical and reliable quantum computing. This section underscores the importance of integrating error correction techniques into quantum algorithms, highlighting the balance between error correction's resource demands and its essential role in preserving computational accuracy. Through careful design and optimization, quantum error correction enables the execution of quantum algorithms in the presence of noise, paving the way for scalable and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

5.7 Operations on 7-Qbit Codewords and 5.8 A 7-Qbit Encoding Circuit

### Integrating Fault-Tolerant Operations and Encoding

The sections on Operations on 7-Qbit Codewords and A 7-Qbit Encoding Circuit delve into the critical aspects of performing logical operations within a fault-tolerant quantum computing framework and the intricacies of encoding quantum information to safeguard against errors.

### Fault-Tolerant Logical Operations

The exploration of logical operations on 7-qubit codewords underscores the sophisticated architecture required to maintain computational integrity in a quantum system. These operations are designed to be fault-tolerant, meaning they can detect and correct errors without compromising the computation's outcome. The fault tolerance is achieved through a combination of carefully constructed quantum gates and error-correcting codes that work in tandem to ensure any errors introduced during the operation can be identified and rectified promptly.

Key aspects include:
- **Transversal Gates**: These gates are crucial for implementing logical operations across the encoded qubits in a manner that intrinsically corrects errors, thereby preserving the encoded information's integrity.
- **Non-destructive Error Checking**: Techniques are employed to assess the presence of errors by examining the quantum state's overall parity without directly measuring any single qubit, thus avoiding the collapse of quantum superposition states.
- **Adaptive Correction Mechanisms**: The system dynamically adjusts its error correction strategies based on the types of errors detected, ensuring efficient correction that minimizes computational disruption.

### 7-Qubit Encoding Circuit

The section on a 7-Qbit Encoding Circuit provides a comprehensive overview of the process and principles behind encoding a single qubit into a 7-qubit codeword. This encoding is pivotal for preparing quantum information for fault-tolerant processing, serving as the foundation for a robust quantum computational framework.

The circuit's design showcases the complexity of quantum error correction, illustrating how individual qubits are entangled in a manner that distributes the quantum information across multiple physical qubits. This redundancy allows the system to detect and correct errors without needing to directly observe the encoded quantum state, thereby preserving its quantum properties.

Highlights include:
- **Encoding Process**: Detailed steps for transforming a single logical qubit into a 7-qubit encoded state, using a series of quantum gates that entangle the qubits in a specific pattern to facilitate error correction.
- **Principles of Operation**: Discussion on the underlying principles, such as quantum entanglement and superposition, that enable the encoding circuit to effectively distribute quantum information across multiple qubits.
- **Error Correction Integration**: Explanation of how the encoding circuit is seamlessly integrated with error correction protocols to detect and correct errors as part of the computational process, ensuring the reliability of quantum operations.

### Unified Approach to Fault Tolerance and Encoding

Combining these sections highlights the cohesive strategy employed in quantum computing to achieve fault tolerance and reliability. Logical operations on encoded quantum states and the process of encoding itself are intertwined aspects of quantum error correction, each playing a vital role in preserving the integrity and functionality of quantum information. This integrated approach is essential for advancing towards practical and scalable quantum computing, capable of executing complex algorithms with high fidelity in the presence of inevitable quantum noise and errors.

5.9 A 5-Qbit Encoding Circuit

### Overview

In this section, the focus shifts to a more compact quantum error-correcting scheme utilizing a 5-qubit codeword. This encoding circuit is crucial for understanding the foundational principles of quantum error correction in a more constrained setting compared to the 7-qubit system. The design and functionality of the 5-qubit encoding circuit are meticulously explained, showcasing the balance between error correction capability and resource efficiency.

### Circuit Design

The circuit's architecture is ingeniously crafted to intertwine five qubits in such a way that it can correct any single-qubit error, be it a bit-flip, phase-flip, or a combination thereof. This capability is remarkable given the circuit's compact size.

- **Gate Composition**: The circuit employs a series of quantum gates, including Hadamard gates for creating superpositions, CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gates for entangling qubits, and phase gates for adjusting the quantum state's phase, all arranged to optimally distribute the quantum information.
- **Entanglement Strategy**: The circuit's design ensures maximal entanglement among the qubits, which is key to its error correction capabilities. This dense entanglement creates a robust framework where the original qubit's information is spread out across all five qubits, providing redundancy and resilience against errors.

### Functionality and Error Correction

The 5-qubit encoding circuit's primary functionality is to encode a single logical qubit's information into a composite state across five physical qubits, making it resistant to errors through redundancy and entanglement.

- **Error Detection and Correction**: The encoded state is designed so that any single-qubit error alters the composite state in a detectable and correctable manner. By examining the syndromes—specific patterns in the qubits that indicate an error—the system can identify and correct errors without collapsing the quantum state.
- **Encoding Process**: Details on the step-by-step process of encoding, which involves preparing the initial qubit in a specific state, followed by the application of quantum gates to entangle it with four additional qubits. The result is a 5-qubit encoded state that contains the original qubit's information in a distributed form.

### Advantages and Challenges

The 5-qubit encoding circuit offers a compact error correction solution, balancing the need for error correction with resource efficiency. This balance is crucial for scalable quantum computing, where minimizing resource use without compromising error correction capabilities is essential.

- **Resource Efficiency**: Compared to the 7-qubit code, the 5-qubit code uses fewer qubits, which is advantageous in quantum systems where physical qubits are a limited resource.
- **Correction Capability**: Despite its compactness, the circuit maintains a robust error correction capability, illustrating the potential for high-density quantum error-correcting codes.
- **Implementation Challenges**: The dense entanglement and precise gate sequences pose challenges in physical implementation, requiring high-fidelity quantum gates and precise control over qubit interactions.

### Conclusion

The 5-qubit encoding circuit represents a pivotal development in quantum computing, offering insights into how quantum information can be protected through strategic entanglement and redundancy. This circuit exemplifies the intricate balance between error correction strength and resource efficiency, providing a template for future quantum error correction strategies that are both effective and practical for scalable quantum computing systems.

Below is the full text of chapter 6. Please list the sections of chapter 6 with a brief description of each section. 
Chapter 6
Protocols that use just a few Qbits
6.1 Bell states
In this chapter we examine some elementary quantum information- theoretic protocols which are often encountered in the context of quan- tum computation, though they also have applications in the broader area of quantum information processing. Because they use only a small number of Qbits, they have all been carried out in at least one laboratory, unlike any but the most trivial and atypical examples of the protocols we have considered in earlier chapters.
Most of these examples make use of the 2-Qbit entangled state,
|ψ00⟩ = √1 |00⟩ + |11⟩ . (6.1) 2
This state can be assigned to two Qbits, each in the state |0⟩, by applying a Hadamard to one of them, and then using it as the control Qbit for a cNOT that targets the other (Figure 6.1(a)):
|ψ00⟩ = C10H1|00⟩. (6.2)
We generalize (6.2) by letting the original pair of unentangled Qbits be in any of the four 2-Qbit computational-basis states |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩ (Figure 6.1(b)):
|ψxy⟩ = C10H1|xy⟩. (6.3)
Since the four states |xy⟩ are an orthonormal set and the Hadamard and cNOT gates are unitary, the four entangled states |ψxy⟩ are also an orthonormal set, called the Bell basis to honor the memory of the physi- cist John S. Bell, who discovered in 1964 one of the most extraordinary facts about 2-Qbit entangled states. We examine a powerful 3-Qbit version of Bell’s theorem in Section 6.6.
If we rewrite (6.3) as
|ψxy⟩ = C10H1XxXy|00⟩, (6.4) 10
and recall that HX = ZH and that either a Z on the control Qbit or an X on the target Qbit commutes with a cNOT, then we have
|ψxy⟩ = ZxXyC10H1|00⟩ = ZxXy √1 |00⟩ + |11⟩ , (6.5) 10 102

 as illustrated in Figure 6.2. This shows that the other Bell states are

obtained from (1/ 2)(|00⟩ + |11⟩) by flipping one of the Qbits, by
changing the + to a −, or by doing both. This, of course, can also be derived directly from (6.3) by letting the Hadamard and cNOT act for each of the four choices for the pair xy.
We now examine a few simple protocols in which some or all of the Bell states (or, in Section 6.6, their 3-Qbit generalizations) play an important role.
6.2 Quantum cryptography
A decade before Shor’s discovery that quantum computation posed a threat to the security of RSA encryption, it was pointed out that Qbits (though the term did not exist at the time) offered a quite different and demonstrably secure basis for the exchange of secret messages.
Of all the various possible applications of quantum mechanics to in- formation processing, quantum cryptography arguably holds the most promise for becoming a practical technology. There are several reasons for this. First of all, it works Qbit by Qbit. The only relevant gates are a small number of simple 1-Qbit gates. Interactions between pairs of Qbits like those mediated by cNOT gates play no role, at least in the most straightforward versions of the protocol.
Furthermore, in actual realizations of quantum cryptography the physical Qbits are extremely simple. Each Qbit is a single photon
Zx

138 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 of light. The state of the Qbit is the linear polarization state of the photon. If the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ describe photons with vertical and
horizontal polarization, then the states H|0⟩ = (1/ 2) |0⟩ + |1⟩ and √
H|1⟩ = (1/ 2) |0⟩ − |1⟩ describe photons diagonally polarized, ei- ther at 45◦ or at −45◦ to the vertical. Photons in any of these four polarization states can be prepared in any number of ways, most sim- ply (if not most efficiently) by sending a weak beam of light through an appropriately oriented polaroid filter. Once a photon has been prepared in its initial polarization state it does not have to be manipulated any further beyond eventually measuring either its horizontal–vertical or its diagonal polarization by, for example, sending it through an appro- priately oriented birefringent crystal and seeing which beam it emerges in, or seeing whether it does or does not get through another appropri- ately oriented polaroid filter. Photons can effectively be shielded from extraneous interactions by sending them through optical fibers, where they can travel in a polarization-preserving manner at the speed of light.
This procedure can be viewed as the simplest possible quantum computation. First the Qbit is assigned an initial state by sending it through a 1-Qbit measurement gate. Then a 1-Qbit unitary gate is or is not applied (depending on whether a subsequent polarization measurement is to be along the same direction as the first). And finally the Qbit is sent through a second 1-Qbit measurement gate.
The usefulness of easily transportable single Qbits for secret com- munication stems from one important cryptographic fact: Alice and Bob can have an unbreakable code if they share newly created identi- cal strings of random bits, called one-time codepads. If they both have such identical random strings, then Alice can take her message, in the form of a long string of zeros and ones, and transform it into its bitwise modulo-2 sum (also called the exclusive or or XOR) with a random string of zeros and ones of the same length taken from her one-time codepad. Flipping or not flipping each bit of a coherent message according to whether the corresponding bit of a random string is 0 or 1 converts the message into another random string. (If this is not obvious, think of the process as flipping or not flipping each bit of the random string, according to whether the corresponding bit of the coherent message is 0 or 1.) Nobody can reconstruct the original string without knowing the random string used to encode it, so only Bob can decode the mes- sage. He does this by taking the XOR of the now meaningless string of zeros and ones, received from Alice, with his own copy of the ran- dom string that she used to do the encoding. The string he gets in this way is M ⊕ S ⊕ S, where M is the message, S is the random string, and M ⊕ S is the encoded message from Alice. Since S ⊕ S = 0, Bob recovers the original message.
The problem with one-time codepads is that they can be used only once. If an eavesdropper (Eve) picks up two messages encoded with
√

6.2 QUANTUM CRYPTOGRAPHY 139
 the same pad, she can take the XOR of the two encoded messages. The random string used to encode the two messages drops out of the pro- cess, leaving the XOR of the two unencoded messages. But the XOR of two meaningful messages, combined with the usual code-breaking tricks based on letter frequencies, can be used (with more subtlety than would be required for a single message) to separate and decode both texts. So to be perfectly secure Alice and Bob must continu- ally refresh their one-time codepad with new identical random strings of bits.
The problem of exchanging such random strings in a secure way might appear to be identical to the original problem of exchanging meaningful messages in a secure way. But at this point quantum me- chanics comes to the rescue and provides an entirely secure means for exchanging identical sequences of random bits. Pause to savor this sit- uation. Nobody has figured out how to exploit quantum mechanics to provide a secure means for directly exchanging meaningful messages. The secure exchange is possible only because the bit sequences are random. On the face of it one would think nothing could be more use- less than such a transmission of noise. What is bizarre is that human ingenuity combined with human perversity has succeeded in inventing a context in which the need to hide information from a third party actually provides a purpose for such an otherwise useless exchange of random strings of bits.
The scheme for doing this is known as BB84 after its inventors,
Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard, who published the idea in 1984.
Alice sends Bob a long sequence of photons. For each photon Alice ran-
domly chooses a polarization type for the photon (horizontal–vertical
or diagonal) and within each type she randomly chooses a polariza-
tion state for the photon – one of the two orthogonal states associated
with that type of polarization. In Qbit language Alice sends Bob a long
sequence of Qbits randomly chosen to be in one of four states: |0⟩ (polar- √
ized horizontally), |1⟩ (polarized vertically), H|0⟩ = (1/ 2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) √
(polarized diagonally along 45◦), or H|1⟩ = (1/ 2)(|0⟩ − |1⟩) (polar- ized diagonally along −45◦).
Reverting from photon-polarization language to our more familiar quantum-computational language, we divide the four equally likely types of Qbits that Alice sends to Bob into two categories: those with state |0⟩ or |1⟩, which we call type-1 Qbits, and those with state H|0⟩ or H|1⟩, which we call type-H Qbits. As each Qbit arrives Bob randomly decides whether to send it directly through a measurement gate, or to apply a Hadamard and only then send it through a measurement gate. We call these two options type-1 and type-H measurements. The Qbits must be individually identifiable – for example by the sequence in which they arrive – so that Alice and Bob can compare what each of them knows about each one.

  Quantum cryptography. For each
Qbit she sends to Bob, Alice randomly decides which type of state to prepare it in (type 1 means |x⟩ and type H means H|x⟩) and which state of thattype(x =0or1)to prepare. For each Qbit he receives from Alice, Bob randomly decides whether (H) or not (1) to apply a Hadamard gate before measuring it. In those cases (about half, enclosed in rectangular boxes) for which Bob’s choice of measurement type is the same as Alice’s choice of state, they acquire identical random bits. When their choices differ they acquire no useful information.

Measure- H Outcome: 1
When Bob has measured all the Qbits in this way, Alice tells him over an insecure channel which of the Qbits she sent him were type- 1 and which were type-H. But she does not reveal which of the two possible states she prepared within each type: |0⟩ or |1⟩ for type-1 Qbits and H|0⟩ or H|1⟩ for type-H. For those Qbits (about half of them) for which Bob’s random choice of measurement type agrees with Alice’s random choice of which type to send, Bob learns from the result of his measurement the actual random bit – 0 or 1 – that Alice chose to send. For those Qbits (the other half) for which Bob’s choice of which type to measure disagrees with Alice’s choice of which type to send, the result of his measurement is completely uncorrelated with Alice’s choice of bit, and reveals nothing about it. This is illustrated in Figure 6.3.
Finally, Bob tells Alice, over an insecure channel, which of the Qbits he subjected to a type of measurement that agreed with her choice of which type to prepare – i.e. which Qbits were of the kind that provides them with identical random bits. They discard the useless half of their data for which Bob’s type of measurement differed from Alice’s type of preparation. They are then able to construct their one-time codepads from the identical strings of random bits they have acquired.
You might wonder why Bob doesn’t wait to decide what type of measurement to make on each Qbit until he learns Alice’s choice of type for that photon, thereby doubling the number of shared random bits. This would indeed be a sensible strategy if Bob could store the Qbits he received from Alice. However, storing individual photons in a polarization-preserving manner is difficult. For feasible quantum cryptography today, Bob must make his decision and measure the po- larization of each photon as it arrives.
The reason Alice randomly varies the type of Qbit she sends to Bob is to provide security against eavesdroppers. If Alice sent all Qbits of the same type, then an eavesdropper, Eve, could acquire the same information as Bob without being detected. If, for example, Alice and Bob had agreed that all the Qbits would be type-1 and Eve learned of this, then she could intercept each Qbit before it reached Bob and send it directly through a measurement gate without altering its state, subsequently sending it (or another Qbit she prepared in the state she just learned) on to Bob. In this way she too could acquire the random

 bit that Alice sends out and that Bob subsequently acquires when he makes his own type-1 measurement. Nothing in the protocol would give Bob a clue that Eve was listening in. But by making each Qbit secretly and randomly of type 1 or type H Alice deprives Eve of this strategy.
The best Eve can do, like Bob, is to make type-1 or type- H measure- ments randomly. In doing so she necessarily reveals her presence. Bob and Alice can determine that Eve has compromised the security of their bits by sacrificing some of the supposedly identical random bits they extracted from the Qbits they both ended up treating in the same way. They take a sample of these bits and check (over an insecure channel) to see whether they actually do agree, as they would in the absence of eavesdropping. If Eve intercepts the Qbits, randomly making type-1 or type-H measurements of her own before sending them on to Bob, then for about half of the useful Qbits her choice will differ from the common choice of Alice and Bob. In about half of those cases, Eve’s intervention will result in the outcome of Bob’s measurement disagreeing with what Alice sent him. If, for example, Eve makes a type-1 measurement of a Qbit that Alice has prepared in the state H|0⟩, then she will necessarily change its state to one or the other of the two states |0⟩ or |1⟩. In either case if Bob then applies a Hadamard before measuring he will get the result 0 only half the time.
So if Eve is systematically intercepting Qbits, Bob’s result will fail to agree with Alice’s preparation for about a quarter of their sample. This warns them that the transmission was insecure. If all the sample data agree except for a tiny fraction, then they can set an upper limit to the fraction of bits that Eve might have picked up, enabling them to make an informed judgment of the security with which they can use the remaining ones.
Can Eve do better by a more sophisticated attack, that involved capturing each of Alice’s Qbits and processing it in a quantum computer that restored it to its initial state, before sending it on to Bob? This would eliminate the possibility of her eavesdropping being revealed to Bob. But the requirement that Alice’s Qbit be returned to its initial state also eliminates the possibility of Eve learning anything useful, for reasons rather like our earlier proof of the no-cloning theorem.
Let |φμ⟩, μ = 0, . . ., 3, be the four possible states of Alice’s Qbit: |0⟩, |1⟩, H|0⟩, and H|1⟩. Let |⟩ be the initial state of the n Qbits in Eve’s computer, and let U be the (n + 1)-Qbit unitary transformation the computer executes on its own Qbits and Alice’s. Since Alice’s Qbit must emerge in its original state, we have

U |φμ⟩ ⊗ |⟩ = |φμ⟩ ⊗ |μ⟩. (6.6)
Eve’s hope is to devise a U that yields four |μ⟩ whose differences enable her, by subsequent processing and measurement, to extract

142 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 useful information about which of the four possible states |φμ⟩ was. But unitary transformations preserve inner products, so
⟨φν|φμ⟩⟨|⟩ = ⟨φν|φμ⟩⟨ν|μ⟩. (6.7) Because ⟨|⟩ = 1 and because ⟨φν |φμ ⟩ ̸= 0 for μν = 02, 03, 12, 13,
it follows that
⟨ν |μ⟩ = 1, μν = 02, 03, 12, 13. (6.8) Since the inner product of two normalized states can be 1 only if they
are identical, it follows from (6.8) that
|0⟩ = |1⟩ = |2⟩ = |3⟩. (6.9)
The price Eve pays for eliminating all traces of her eavesdropping is that the resulting state of her quantum computer can teach her nothing whatever about the four possible states of Alice’s Qbit.
There is a less practical version of this cryptographic protocol that appears, at first sight, to be different, but turns out to be exactly the same. Suppose that there were some central source that produced pairs of Qbits in the entangled state
|⟩ = √1 |00⟩ + |11⟩ , (6.10) 2
and then sent one member of each pair to Alice and the other to Bob. One easily verifies that
H⊗H √1 |00⟩+|11⟩ = √1 |00⟩+|11⟩ , (6.11) 22
so if Alice and Bob make measurements of the same type, they will get identical random results.
This might seem even more secure than the first protocol, since the Qbits are in an entangled state until Alice or Bob actually makes a measurement. The correlated bits – the outcomes of the measurement – do not even exist until a measurement has been made, and that does not happen until both Qbits are safely in Alice’s and Bob’s separate possession. But this is only the case if Eve does not intercept a Qbit. If she does measure one before it gets to Bob or Alice, then the correlated bits do come into existence at the moment of her own measurement. This is later than in the first protocol (when each bit exists from the moment Alice performs her measurement) but early enough to help Eve in the same way as before.
If Alice and Bob decided to produce their perfectly correlated ran- dom bits by always making type-1 measurements then if Eve finds this out she can intercept one member of the pair with type-1 measurements of her own, disentangling the state prematurely, but in a way that en- ables her to learn what each random bit is, while not altering the perfect correlations between the values Alice and Bob will subsequently mea- sure. Alice and Bob can guard against this possibility by each randomly

But
6.3 BIT COMMITMENT 143
 (and, necessarily, independently) alternating between type-1 and type- H measurements, and then following a procedure identical to the one they used when Alice sent Bob Qbits in definite states.
This returns us to the original protocol that made no use of entangled pairs. Indeed, if Alice measures her member of the entangled pair (making either a type-1 or a type- H measurement) before Bob measures his, this is equivalent to her sending Bob a Qbit with a randomly selected state that she knows. The only difference is that now the random choice of which of the two states to send within each type is not made by Alice tossing a coin, but by the basic laws of quantum mechanics that guarantee that the outcome of her own measurement is random.
6.3 Bit commitment
One can try to formulate a similar protocol for a procedure called bit commitment. Suppose that Alice wishes to assure Bob that she has made a binary decision by a certain date, but does not wish to reveal that decision until some future time. She can do this by writing YES or NO on a card, putting the card in a box, locking the box, and sending the box, but not the key, to Bob. Once the box is in Bob’s possession he can be sure that Alice has not altered her decision, but while the key is in Alice’s possession she can be sure that Bob has not learned what that decision was. When it is time for her to reveal the decision she sends the key to Bob who opens the box and learns what it was.
Of course Alice might worry about Bob breaking into the box by other means. Quantum mechanics offers a more secure procedure (but with an exotic loophole, which we return to momentarily). Alice pre- pares a large number n of labeled Qbits. If her answer is YES, she takes each Qbit to be randomly in the state |0⟩ or the state |1⟩. If her answer is NO, she prepares each Qbit randomly in the state H|0⟩ or H|1⟩. In either case she notes which Qbits are in which state, and then sends them all off to Bob, who stores them in a way that preserves both their state and their labels. (As noted above, such storage is beyond the range of current technology for polarized photons.)
If Bob has a collection of n Qbits, each of which has been chosen with equal probability to be in one of two orthogonal states |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩, then there is no way for Bob to get any hint of what the two orthogonal states are. If, for example, he measures every Qbit, then the probability of getting 0 is
p(0) = 1 |⟨0|φ⟩|2 + 1 |⟨0|ψ⟩|2. (6.12) 22
|⟨0|φ⟩|2 + |⟨0|ψ⟩|2 = 1, (6.13)

144 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 since this is the sum of the squared moduli of the amplitudes of the expansion of |0⟩ in the orthonormal basis given by |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩:
|0⟩ = |φ⟩⟨φ|0⟩ + |ψ⟩⟨ψ|0⟩. (6.14) So p(0) = 1. Bob’s measurement outcomes are completely random,
2
regardless of what the orthogonal pair of states actually is.
In Appendix P it is shown, more generally, that no information Bob can extract from his collection of Qbits can distinguish between the case in which each has a 50–50 chance of being in the state |0⟩ or |1⟩ and the case in which each has a 50–50 chance of being in the state H|0⟩ or H|1⟩. There is no way Bob can learn Alice’s choice from the Qbits that Alice has sent him. He cannot break into the locked box.
(It is crucial for Bob’s inability to learn Alice’s choice that, regardless
of what that choice is, she sends him a collection of Qbits each of whose
two possible states is picked randomly. If, for example, she sent him
exactly 12 n Qbits in the state |0⟩ and 12 n in the state |1⟩, in some random
order, then with probability 1 Bob would get an equal number of zeros
and ones if he measured in the computational basis. But if he applied H
before measuring, the outcome of each measurement would be random,
and the probability of getting equal numbers of zeros and ones for his
2/(π n )) for large n. So if he got equal numbers of zeros and ones he could be rather sure that Alice had sent him photons in the states |0⟩ and |1⟩ rather than in
the states H|0⟩ and H|1⟩.)
When the time comes for Alice to reveal her choice for the pair of
orthogonal states, she says to Bob something like this: “My answer was YES, so each of the Qbits I sent you was either in the state |0⟩ or in the state |1⟩. To prove this I now tell you that I put Qbits 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, ... into the state |0⟩ and I put Qbits 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12, ... into the state |1⟩. You can confirm that I’m telling the truth by measuring each Qbit directly.”
Bob makes the direct measurements and gets every one of Alice’s predicted outcomes. If instead Alice had sent him Qbits whose states were randomly H|0⟩ or H|1⟩ she could do the same trick by telling Bob exactly what he would find if he preceded each of his measurements with a Hadamard gate. But there is no way she could do the trick for measurements preceded by Hadamard gates in the first case or for direct measurements in the second. The best she could do if she wanted to deceive Bob would be to make random guesses for each outcome, and with n Qbits she would succeed in fooling him only with probability 1/2n . So this works perfectly well, and without the worry of Bob possessing unexpected safe-cracking skills.
But, as noted above, there is a loophole – in fact, a fatal problem. The technological skills required to take advantage of the loophole are spectacularly greater than those required for the naive protocol, so one could imagine a stretch of years, decades, or even centuries during
√
 measurements would be quite small (asymptotically

6.3 BIT COMMITMENT 145
 which the naive protocol might actually be useful. But ultimately it will be insecure. Suppose that Alice, unknown to Bob, has actually prepared n labeled pairs in the entangled state (6.10), sending one member to Bob while retaining the other for herself. Then the Qbits Bob receives will have no states of their own, being entangled with the Qbits Alice keeps for herself. Nevertheless, if Bob chooses to test some of them with measurements, (6.11) insures that the results he gets will be indistinguishable from the random outcomes he would have got if Alice had been playing the game honestly. No hint of her deception will be revealed by any test Bob can perform.
But now when the time comes for Alice to reveal her choice, if she wants to prove to Bob that it was YES, she makes a direct measurement on each of the Qbits she has kept and correctly informs Bob what he will get if he makes a direct measurement on each of the paired Qbits. But if she wants to prove that it was NO, she instead applies Hadamards before measuring each of her Qbits, enabling her, because of the identity (6.11), to tell Bob what he will find if he also applies Hadamards before mea- suring his own Qbits. So she can use entangled pairs of Qbits to cheat at what would otherwise be a perfectly secure bit-commitment protocol.
Alice can cheat in the same way even if Bob measures his Qbits (randomly applying or not applying a Hadamard before each measure- ment) before she “reveals” her commitment. If she wants to “prove” to Bob she had sent him YES she directly measures each of her Qbits and tells Bob all her results. He notes that they do indeed agree with all the results he found for his direct measurements, and is persuaded that she had indeed sent him YES. To “prove” she sent him NO she applies Hadamards before measuring each of her Qbits.
Of course the success of Alice’s cheating depends crucially on Bob’s knowing all about 1-Qbit states, but never having taken the kind of course in quantum mechanics that would have taught him anything about entangled 2-Qbit states. If Bob is as sophisticated a student of the quantum theory as Alice, they will both realize that the protocol is fatally flawed, since it can be defeated by entanglement.
It is in this context that Einstein’s famous complaint about spooky actions at a distance (“spukhafte Fernwirkungen”) seems pertinent. By finally measuring her members of the entangled pairs, Alice seems to convert the distant Qbits in Bob’s possession into the kind she decep- tively said she had sent him long ago, while retaining until the last minute the option of which of the two kinds to pick. But of course Alice’s action is not so much on the Qbits in Bob’s possession as it is on what it is possible for her to tell him about what he can learn from those Qbits. It is this peculiar tension between what is objective (ontology) and what is known (epistemology) that makes quantum mechanics such a source of delight (or anguish) to the philosophically inclined.
Something like Alice’s discovery of the value of entanglement for cheating actually happened in the historical development of these ideas

 about quantum information processing. When the bit-commitment protocol described above was first put forth it was realized that entan- gled pairs could be used to thwart it, but more sophisticated versions were proposed that were believed to be immune to cheating with en- tanglement. There developed a controversy over whether some form of bit commitment could or could not be devised that would be secure even if entanglement were fully exploitable. The current consensus is that there is no way to use Qbits in a bit-commitment protocol that cannot be defeated by using entangled states. Indeed, it has even been suggested that the structure of quantum mechanics might be uniquely determined by requiring it to enable the secure exchange of random strings of bits, as in quantum cryptography, but not to enable bit com- mitment. Nobody has managed to show this. It does seem implausible that God would have taken as a fundamental principle of design that certain kinds of covert activity should be possible while others should be forbidden.
6.4 Quantum dense coding
Although an infinite amount of information is needed to specify the state |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ of a single Qbit, there is no way for somebody who has acquired possession of the Qbit to learn what that state is, as we have often noted. If Alice prepares a Qbit in the state |ψ⟩ and sends it to Bob, all he can do is apply a unitary transformation of his choice and then measure the Qbit, getting the value 0 or 1. After that the state of the Qbit is either |0⟩ or |1⟩ and no further measurement can teach him anything about its original state |ψ ⟩. The most Alice can communicate to Bob by sending him a single Qbit is a single bit of information.
If, however, Alice has one member of an entangled pair of Qbits in the state
|⟩ = √1 |0⟩|0⟩ + |1⟩|1⟩ (6.15) 2
and Bob has the other, then by suitably preparing her member of the pair and then sending it to Bob, she can convey to him two bits of information. She does this by first applying the transformation 1, X, Z, or ZX to her Qbit, depending on whether she wants to send Bob the message 00, 01, 10, or 11. If hers is the Qbit on the left in (6.15) these transform the state of the pair into one of the four mutually orthogonal Bell states (6.5),
1a|⟩=√1 |0⟩|0⟩+|1⟩|1⟩, 2
Xa|⟩=√1 |1⟩|0⟩+|0⟩|1⟩, 2
Za|⟩=√1 |0⟩|0⟩−|1⟩|1⟩, 2
ZaXa|⟩=√1 |0⟩|1⟩−|1⟩|0⟩. 2
(6.16)

6.4 QUANTUM DENSE CODING 147
 She then sends her Qbit over to Bob. He sends the pair through the controlled-NOT gate Cab, using the Qbit he received from Alice as control, to get
Cab1a|⟩=√1 |0⟩+|1⟩|0⟩, 2
CabXa|⟩=√1 |0⟩+|1⟩|1⟩, 2
CabZa|⟩=√1 |0⟩−|1⟩|0⟩, 2
CabZaXa|⟩=√1 |0⟩−|1⟩|1⟩, 2
and then he applies a Hadamard transform to get Ha Cab 1a |⟩ = |0⟩|0⟩,
Ha Cab Xa |⟩ = |0⟩|1⟩, Ha Cab Za |⟩ = |1⟩|0⟩,
Ha Cab Za Xa |⟩ = |1⟩|1⟩.
(6.17)
(6.18)
Measuring the two Qbits then gives him 00, 01, 10, or 11 – precisely the two-bit message Alice wished to send.
This process of transforming the Bell basis back into the compu- tational basis – i.e. undoing the process (6.3) by which the Bell basis was constructed from the computational basis – and then measuring is called “measuring in the Bell basis.”
One can directly demonstrate that this works with circuit diagrams, without going through any of the analysis in (6.15)–(6.18). Suppose that Alice represents the two bits x and y she wishes to transmit to Bob as the computational-basis state |x⟩|y⟩ of two Qbits (the top two wires, Figure 6.4(a)). If Bob has two Qbits initially in the state |0⟩|0⟩ (the bottom two wires in Figure 6.4(a)), then the circuit in Figure 6.4(a) gets the two bits to Bob in a straightforward classical way, transforming the state |x⟩|y⟩|0⟩|0⟩ on the right to |x⟩|y⟩|x⟩|y⟩ on the left by means of direct Qbit-to-Qbit coupling via two cNOT gates. The procedure involves only classical operations on classically meaningful states. It gets the two bits from Alice to Bob by explicit interactions between her Qbits and his. It would work equally well for Cbits.
One can transform this direct classical procedure into the more exotic quantum protocol by expanding the cNOT gates into products of quantum gates. One first expands one of the C gates into HCZH in Figure 6.4(b). Because Z acting on the control Qbit commutes with C and because C is its own inverse, we can further expand Figure 6.4(b) to Figure 6.4(c). We can then bring the H and C gates on either side of the CZ to the extreme left and right to get Figure 6.4(d). We can also expand the two C gates on the left of Figure 6.4(d) into the three C gates on the left of Figure 6.4(e), since the action of either set is to flip the target Qbit if and only if the computational-basis states of the two control Qbits are different, while leaving the states of the control

Qbits unaltered. Because the state H|0⟩ = (1/ 2)(|0⟩ + |1⟩) is invari-
ant under the action of X, the C on the extreme left of Figure 6.4(e) acts as the identity, and Figure 6.4(e) simplifies to Figure 6.4(f).
The fact that Figure 6.4(f) has the same action as Figure 6.4(a)
contains all the content of the dense-coding protocol. The pair of gates
C10H1 on the left of Figure 6.4(f) acts on the state |0⟩|0⟩ to produce
the entangled state (6.15). The bottom Qbit of the pair, Qbit 0, is given
to Bob and the upper one, Qbit 1, is given to Alice, who also possesses
the upper two, Qbits 2 and 3. The pair of gates CZ C21 acts as 1, X, Z, 31
or ZX on Qbit 1 depending on whether the states of Qbits 3 and 2 are |0⟩|0⟩, |0⟩|1⟩, |1⟩|0⟩, or |1⟩|1⟩. This reproduces the transformation Alice applies to the member of the entangled pair in her possession, depending on the values of the two bits she wishes to transmit to Bob. Alice then sends Qbit 1 to Bob. The final pair H1C10 on the right is precisely the transformation (6.18) that Bob performs on the reunited entangled pair before making his measurement, which yields the values x, y that Alice wished to transmit.
Like dense coding, many tricks of quantum information theory, in- cluding the one we examine next, teleportation, rely on two or more people sharing entangled Qbits, prepared some time ago, carefully stored in their remote locations awaiting an occasion for their use. While the preparation of entangled Qbits (in the form of photons) and their transmission to distant places has been achieved, putting them into entanglement-preserving, local, long-term storage remains a dif- ficult challenge.
6.5 Teleportation
Suppose that Alice has a Qbit in a state
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, (6.19)
but she does not know the amplitudes α and β. Carol, for example, may have prepared the Qbit for Alice by taking a Qbit initially assigned the standard state |0⟩, applying a specific unitary transformation to it, and then giving it to Alice, without telling her what unitary transformation she applied.
Alice would like to reassign that precise state to another Qbit pos- sessed by Bob. Neither Alice nor Bob (who could be far away from Alice) has any access to the other’s Qbit. Alice is, however, allowed to send “classical information” to Bob – e.g. she can talk to him over the telephone. And, crucially, Bob’s Qbit shares with a second Qbit of Alice the 2-Qbit entangled state
|⟩ = √1 |0⟩|0⟩ + |1⟩|1⟩ . (6.20) 2

150 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 The no-cloning theorem prohibits duplicating the unknown state of Alice’s first Qbit, either far away from her or nearby. But it turns out to be possible for Alice and Bob to cooperate over the telephone in assigning the state |ψ⟩ to Bob’s member of the entangled pair. The no-cloning theorem is not violated because in doing so Alice obliterates all traces of the state |ψ⟩ from either of her own Qbits. The process – called teleporting the state from Alice to Bob – also eliminates the en- tanglement Alice and Bob formerly shared. For each shared entangled pair, they can teleport just a single 1-Qbit state. The term “teleporta- tion” emphasizes that the state assignment acquired by Bob’s Qbit no longer applies to Alice’s; it has been transported from her Qbit to his.
Here is how teleportation works. Alice’s first Qbit and the entangled pair she shares with Bob are characterized by the 3-Qbit state
|ψ⟩a|⟩ab = α|0⟩a +β|1⟩a √1 |0⟩a|0⟩b +|1⟩a|1⟩b , (6.21) 2
where I have given the state symbols for the Qbits in Alice’s and Bob’s possession subscripts a and b. To teleport the unknown state of her Qbit to Bob’s member of the entangled pair, Alice first applies a cNOT gate, using her first Qbit in the state |ψ⟩ as the control and her member of the shared entangled pair as the target. This produces the 3-Qbit state
α|0⟩a √1 |0⟩a |0⟩b + |1⟩a |1⟩b + β|1⟩a √1 |1⟩a |0⟩b + |0⟩a |1⟩b . 22
(6.22) Next she applies a Hadamard transformation H to her first Qbit, giving
all three Qbits the state
α √1 |0⟩a + |1⟩a √1 |0⟩a |0⟩b + |1⟩a |1⟩b 22
+β√1 |0⟩a −|1⟩a √1 |1⟩a|0⟩b +|0⟩a|1⟩b 22
= 1 |0⟩a |0⟩a α|0⟩b + β|1⟩b + 1 |1⟩a |0⟩a α|0⟩b − β|1⟩b 22
+ 1 |0⟩a |1⟩a α|1⟩b + β|0⟩b + 1 |1⟩a |1⟩a α|1⟩b − β|0⟩b . (6.23) 22
Now Alice measures both Qbits in her possession. (As remarked in Section 6.4, such an application of cNOT and Hadamard gates, immediately followed by measurement gates, is called “measuring in the Bell basis.”) If the result is 00, Bob’s Qbit will indeed acquire the state |ψ⟩ originally possessed by Alice’s first Qbit (whose state would then be reduced to |0⟩). But if the result of Alice’s measurement is 10, 01, or 11 then the state of Bob’s Qbit becomes
α|0⟩b − β|1⟩b , α|1⟩b + β|0⟩b , or α|1⟩b − β|0⟩b . (6.24)
In each of these three cases there is a unitary transformation that re- stores the state of Bob’s Qbit to Alice’s original state |ψ⟩. In the first case we can apply Z (which leaves |0⟩ alone but changes the sign of |1⟩), in the second case, X (which interchanges |0⟩ and |1⟩), and in the third case, ZX.

6.5 TELEPORTATION 151
 So all Alice need do to transfer the state of her Qbit to Bob’s member of their entangled pair is to telephone Bob and report to him the results of her two measurements. He then knows whether the state has already been transferred (if Alice’s result is 00) or what unitary transformation he must apply to his member of the entangled pair in order to com- plete the transfer (if Alice’s result is one of the other three.) Note the resemblance to quantum error correction: by making a measurement Alice acquires the information needed for Bob to reconstruct a partic- ular quantum state, without anybody acquiring any information about what the state actually is.
This appears to be remarkable. A general state of a Qbit is described by two complex numbers α and β that take on a continuum of values, constrained only by the requirement that |α|2 + |β|2 = 1. Yet, with the aid of a standard entangled pair, whose state does not depend on α and β, Alice is able to provide Bob with a Qbit described by the unknown state, at the price of only two bits of classical information (giving the results of her two measurements) and the loss of the entanglement of their pair.
But of course the teleportation process does not communicate to Bob the information that can be encoded in α and β. Bob is no more able to learn the values of α and β from manipulating his Qbit, now assigned the state |ψ⟩, than Alice was able to do when it was her Qbit that was assigned the same state |ψ⟩. On the other hand Alice’s state could be produced at a crucial stage of an elaborate quantum computation, and its transfer to Bob could enable him to continue with the computation on his own far-away quantum computer, so one can achieve a nontrivial objective by such teleportations.
Like dense coding, teleportation can also be constructed by manip- ulating an elementary classical circuit diagram, without going through any of the analysis in (6.21)–(6.24). Figure 6.5(a) shows a circuit that exchanges the state |ψ⟩ = |x⟩ of Alice’s Cbit with the state |0⟩ of Bob’s Cbit, regardless of whether x = 0 or 1. The transfer is achieved by direct physical coupling between the two Cbits. As a linear quantum circuit it continues to perform this exchange for arbitrary superpo- sitions, |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩. The entire teleportation protocol can be constructed by appropriately expanding the two gates in Figure 6.5(a), with the aid of an ancillary Qbit. The aim of the expansion is to elim- inate the direct interaction between Alice’s and Bob’s Qbits through the two cNOT gates in Figure 6.5(a), in favor of the telephoned mes- sage from Alice to Bob, and the interaction necessary to produce their shared pair of entangled Qbits (which can take place well before Alice has even acquired her Qbit in the state |ψ⟩).
In Figure 6.5(b) an ancillary Qbit, not acted upon throughout the process, is introduced in the state
|φ⟩=H|0⟩= √1 |0⟩+|1⟩ . (6.25) 2

      Fig 6.5 A circuit-theoretic derivation of the quantum teleportation protocol.
 
In Figure 6.5(c) the identities X = HZH and 1 = HH have been used to rewrite the cNOT gate on the right of Figure 6.5(b), and an additional cNOT gate has been added on the left, which acts as the identity, since X acts as the identity on the state H|0⟩.
Figure 6.5(d) follows from Figure 6.5(c) because the action of CZ is independent of which Qbit is the control and which the target, and because the two cNOT gates on the left of Figure 6.5(c) have exactly the same action as the three cNOT gates on the left of Figure 6.5(d): acting on the computational basis, both sets of gates apply X on both of the bottom two wires if the state of the top wire is |1⟩ and act as the identity if the state of the top wire is |0⟩.
Figure 6.5(e) follows from Figure 6.5(d) if we write the |φ⟩ on the left of Figure 6.5(d) as H|0⟩ and explicitly write the |0⟩ on the right of Figure 6.5(d) as H|φ⟩. But Figure 6.5(e) is an automated version of teleportation. To relate it to ordinary teleportation, introduce mea- surements of the upper two Qbits after the circuit of Figure 6.5(e) has acted, as in Figure 6.5(f). Their effect is to collapse the states of each of the two upper wires randomly and independently to |0⟩ or |1⟩. But as noted in Section 3.6, measurement of a control Qbit commutes with any operation controlled by that Qbit, so the measurement gates can be moved to the positions they occupy in Figure 6.5(g).
Figure 6.5(g) is precisely the teleportation protocol. The two gates on the left transform the two lower Qbits into the entangled state (6.20). The subsequent applications to the top two Qbits of cNOT followed by H followed by two measurement gates are precisely Alice’s “measurement in the Bell basis.” Since Alice knows the outcomes of the measurements, she knows whether the subsequent cNOT and CZ gates will or will not act, and she can replace these physical couplings by a phone call to Bob telling him whether or not to apply X and/or Z directly to his own Qbit.
Figure 6.6 demonstrates that entanglement can also be teleported. The figure reproduces parts (b), (e), and (g) of Figure 6.5 with three changes. (1) A bar representing n Qbits in the n-Qbit state |⟩i has been added above each part of the figure. No operations act on these additional Qbits. (2) The state to be teleported has been given a sub- script i so it is now one of several possible states |ψi ⟩. (3) Because of the linearity of the unitary gates we may sum over the index i. The effect of the circuit is to transfer participation in the entangled
|i ⟩|ψi ⟩ from the third wire from the bottom to the bottom
So even if Alice’s Qbit has no state of its own but is entangled with other Qbits, Alice can use the same protocol to teleport its role in the entangled state over to Bob’s Qbit. The result is that Bob’s Qbit becomes entangled in exactly the same way Alice’s was, and Alice’s Qbit becomes entirely unentangled.

6.6 The GHZ puzzle
We conclude with another illustration of just how strange the behavior of Qbits can be. The situation described below is a 3-Qbit version of one first noticed by Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger (“GHZ”) in the late 1980s, which gives a very striking version of Bell’s theorem. An alternative version, discovered by Lucien Hardy in the early 1990s, is given in Appendix D.
Consider the 3-Qbit state
|⟩ = 1 |000⟩ − |110⟩ − |011⟩ − |101⟩ . (6.26) 2
Note that the form of |⟩ is explicitly invariant under any permutation of the three Qbits. Numbering the Qbits from left to right 2, 1, and 0, we have
H
      M
        M
              Since
|⟩ = C21H2X2 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ . 2
√1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ = C21C20H2X2|000⟩, 2
(6.27)
(6.28)

(6.27) and (6.28) provide an explicit construction of |⟩ from elemen- tary 1- and 2-Qbit gates acting on the standard state |0⟩ .
3
Because |⟩ in the form (6.26) and the state (1/ 2)(|000⟩ − |111⟩) appearing in (6.27) are both invariant under permutations of the Qbits 0, 1, and 2, any of the other five forms of (6.27) associated with permu-
tations of the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 are equally valid. In particular
|⟩ = C12H1X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ . 2
It follows from (6.29) that
H2H1|⟩ = H2H1C12H1X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ 2
= H2H1C12H1H2 H2X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ 2
= C21H2X1 |000⟩ − |111⟩
(6.29)
(6.30)
(since sandwiching a cNOT between Hadamards exchanges target and control Qbits). Comparing the last expression in (6.30) with the form of |⟩ in (6.27) reveals that
H2H1|⟩ = Z2X1|⟩ (6.31)
(which can, of course, be confirmed more clumsily directly from the definition (6.26) of |⟩.) Because of the invariance of |⟩ under per- mutation of the three Qbits we also have
H2H0|⟩ = Z2X0|⟩, (6.32) H1H0|⟩ = Z1X0|⟩. (6.33)
Now suppose that we have prepared three Qbits in the state |⟩ and then allowed no further interactions among them. If we measure each Qbit, it follows from the form (6.26) that because |⟩ is a superposition of computational-basis states having either none or two of the Qbits in the state |1⟩, the three outcomes are constrained to satisfy
x2 ⊕x1 ⊕x0 =0 (6.34)
(where ⊕, as usual, denotes addition modulo 2).
Suppose, on the other hand, that we apply Hadamards to Qbits
2 and 1 before measuring all three. According to (6.31) this has the effect of flipping the state of Qbit 1 in each term of the superposition (6.26) (and changing the signs of some of the terms). As a result the 3-Qbit state (6.26) is changed into a superposition of computational- basis states having either one or three of the Qbits in the state |1⟩. So if the outcomes are x2H, x1H, and x0, we must have
6.6 THE GHZ PUZZLE 155
 x2H ⊕x1H ⊕x0 =1. (6.35)
√

156 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 Similarly, if we apply Hadamards to Qbits 2 and 0 before measuring all three, then (6.32) requires that the outcomes must obey
x2H ⊕x1 ⊕x0H =1, (6.36) and if Hadamards are applied to Qbits 1 and 0 then according to (6.33)
if all three are measured we will have
x2 ⊕x1H ⊕x0H =1. (6.37)
Consider now the following question. If we are talking about a single trio of Qbits, assigned the state |⟩, must the x0 appearing in (6.34) be the same as the x0 appearing in (6.35)? A little reflection reveals that this question makes no sense. After all, (6.34) describes the outcomes of immediately measuring the three Qbits, whereas (6.35) describes the outcomes of measuring them after Hadamards have been applied to Qbits 2 and 1. Since only one of these two possibilities can actually be carried out, there is no way to compare the results of measuring Qbit 0 in the two cases. You can’t compare the x0 you found in the case you actually carried out with the x0 you might have found in the case you didn’t carry out. It’s just a stupid question.
Or is it? Suppose that Qbits 2 and 1 are measured before Qbit 0 is measured. If no Hadamards were applied before the measurements of 2 and 1, then (6.34) assures us that when 0 is finally measured the result will be
x0 = x1 ⊕ x2. (6.38)
So the outcome of measuring Qbit 0 is predetermined by the outcomes of the earlier measurements of Qbits 2 and 1. Since all interactions among the Qbits ceased after the state |⟩ had been prepared, subject- ing Qbits 2 and 1 to measurement gates can have no effect on Qbit 0. Since the outcomes of the measurements of Qbits 2 and 1 determine in advance the outcome of the subsequent measurement of Qbit 0, it would seem that Qbit 0 was already predisposed to give the result (6.38) upon being measured. Because the Qbits did not interact after their initial state was prepared, it would seem that Qbit 0 must have had that predisposition even before Qbits 2 and 1 were actually measured to reveal what the result of measuring Qbit 0 would have to be.
This is a bit disconcerting, since prior to any measurements the state of the Qbits was (6.26), in which none of them was individually predisposed to reveal any particular value. Indeed, it would seem that the 3-Qbit state (6.26) gives an incomplete description of the Qbits. The omitted predisposition of Qbit 0 seems to be an additional element of reality that a more complete description than that afforded by the quantum theory would take into account.

6.6 THE GHZ PUZZLE 157
 But if Qbit 0 did indeed have a predetermined predisposition to give x0 when measured, even before Qbits 1 and 2 were measured to reveal what x0 actually was, then the value of x0 surely would not be altered if Hadamards were applied to Qbits 1 and 2 before they were measured, since the Qbits have ceased to interact, and the predisposition to give x0 was present before the decision to apply Hadamards or not had been made. This means that the value x0 appearing in (6.34) must indeed be identical to the value of x0 appearing in (6.35). So our question is not meaningless. The answer is Yes!
Such an argument for elements of reality – predetermined values – was put forth in 1935 (in a different context) by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR). The controversy and discussion it has given rise to has steadily increased over the past seven decades. The terms “incomplete” and “element of reality” originated with EPR. Today it is Einstein’s most cited paper.
The wonderful thing about three Qbits in the state (6.26) is that they not only provide a beautiful illustration of the EPR argument, but also, when examined further, reveal that the appealing argument establishing predetermined measurement outcomes cannot be correct. To see this, note that exactly the same reasoning establishes that the values of x1 appearing in (6.34) and (6.36) must be the same, as well as the values of x2 appearing in (6.34) and (6.37). And the same line of thought establishes that the values of x0H in (6.37) and (6.36) must be the same, as well as the values of x1H in (6.37) and (6.35) and the values of x2H in (6.36) and (6.35).
If all this is true, then adding together the left sides of (6.34)–(6.37) must give 0 modulo 2, since each of x2, x1, x0, x2H, x1H, and x0H appears in exactly two of the equations. But the modulo 2 sum of the right sides is 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1 = 1.
So the appealing EPR argument must be wrong. There are no el- ements of reality – no predetermined measurement outcomes that a more complete theory would take into account. The answer to what is mistaken in the simple and persuasive reasoning that led Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen to the existence of elements of reality is still a mat- ter of debate more than 70 years later. How, after all, can Qbit 0 and its measurement gate “know” that if they interact only after Qbits 1 and 2 have gone through their own measurement gates (and no Hadamards were applied) then the result of the measurement of Qbit 0 must be given by (6.38)?
The best explanation anybody has come up with to this day is to insist that no explanation is needed beyond what one can infer from the laws of quantum mechanics. Those laws are correct. Quantum mechanics works. There is no controversy about that. What fail to work are attempts to provide underlying mechanisms, that go be- yond the quantum-mechanical rules, for how certain strong quantum

158 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 correlations can actually operate. One gets puzzled only if one tries to understand how the rules can work not only for the actual situation in which they are applied, but also in alternative situations that might have been chosen but were not.
By concluding with this “paradoxical” state of affairs, I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the quantum-theoretic descriptionofQbitsandthegatesthatactonthem.Onthecontrary,the quantum theory has to be regarded as the must accurate and successful theory in the history of physics, and there is no doubt whatever among physicists that if the formidable technological obstacles standing in the way of building a quantum computer can be overcome, then the computer will behave exactly as described in the preceding chapters.
But I cannot, in good conscience, leave you without a warning that the simple theory of Qbits developed here, though correct, is in some respects exceedingly strange. The strangeness emerges only when one seeks to go beyond the straightforward rules enunciated in Chapter 1. In particular one must not ask for an underlying mechanism that ac- counts not only for the behavior of the circuit actually applied to a particular collection of Qbits, but also for the possible behavior of other circuits that might have been applied to the very same collection of Qbits, but were not.
A good motto for the quantum physicist and for future quantum computer scientists might be “What didn’t happen didn’t happen.” On that firm note I conclude (except for the 16 appendices that follow).

The section on Bell states in Chapter 6 delves into the foundational aspects of quantum entanglement, focusing on the unique properties and generation of the Bell states. These states are crucial for understanding quantum mechanics and its applications in quantum information theory.

Bell states, or EPR pairs, named after Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, are maximally entangled quantum states of two qubits. They form an orthonormal basis for the two-qubit system and are represented as:
- $|\psi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$
- $|\psi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle - |11\rangle)$
- $|\phi^{+}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle + |10\rangle)$
- $|\phi^{-}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01\rangle - |10\rangle)$

These states are generated from the computational basis (|00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩) through the application of quantum gates—specifically, the Hadamard gate (H) followed by a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. The process involves first applying the Hadamard gate to one qubit, which creates a superposition, and then applying the CNOT gate, which entangles the two qubits based on the state of the qubit that underwent the Hadamard transformation.

The significance of the Bell states in quantum information protocols cannot be overstated. They are the simplest examples of entangled states yet offer profound insights into the non-local properties of quantum systems. The Bell states violate classical intuitions about separability and locality—principles that are foundational to classical physics. This violation is famously exploited in tests of quantum mechanics against classical theories of physics, such as Bell's theorem experiments, which confirm the quantum prediction of entanglement and the non-locality of quantum mechanics.

In practical terms, Bell states are essential for various quantum information processes, including quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and quantum cryptography. These protocols leverage the entanglement properties of the Bell states to perform tasks that are impossible or highly inefficient in classical systems. For example, quantum teleportation uses a pair of entangled qubits (a Bell state) to transmit the state of a qubit from one location to another without moving the physical qubit itself. This process relies on the entanglement to instantaneously "teleport" the state across space, demonstrating the non-locality of quantum information.

Overall, the exploration of Bell states in this section lays the groundwork for understanding entanglement's pivotal role in quantum computing and quantum information theory, illustrating the departure from classical physics and highlighting the potential for revolutionary advances in technology.

Section 6.2 of Chapter 6 dives into the fascinating world of quantum cryptography, with a special focus on the BB84 protocol developed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. This protocol leverages the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to achieve secure communication, ensuring that any attempt at eavesdropping can be detected by the communicating parties.

Quantum cryptography stands out because it uses individual qubits—quantum bits—as the basic unit of information. These qubits can represent much more complex states than their classical counterparts due to the principles of superposition and entanglement. In the context of BB84, the protocol uses two sets of orthogonal bases, often represented as polarizations of photons: rectilinear ($|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$) and diagonal ($|+\rangle$ and $|-\rangle$), to encode information.

Here's a breakdown of how the protocol works:

1. **Preparation and Transmission:** Alice wants to send a secure key to Bob. She prepares a sequence of qubits, each randomly in one of the four states ($|0\rangle$, $|1\rangle$, $|+\rangle$, $|-\rangle$). Each qubit is sent over a quantum channel to Bob.

2. **Measurement by Bob:** Upon receiving each qubit, Bob randomly chooses one of the two bases (rectilinear or diagonal) to measure it. The choice of basis is crucial because measuring a qubit in the same basis as it was prepared yields the original state, while measuring in the wrong basis gives a random outcome due to the collapse of the quantum state.

3. **Basis Reconciliation:** After the transmission, Alice and Bob communicate over a public channel to discuss the bases used for each qubit, without revealing the measurement outcomes. They discard any bits where Bob used a different basis from Alice's preparation, leaving them with a smaller, shared key.

4. **Eavesdropping Detection:** To check for eavesdroppers (Eve), Alice and Bob compare a subset of their remaining bits. If Eve has tried to measure any qubits, her measurements would sometimes have been in the wrong basis, introducing errors in Bob's measurements. A higher than expected error rate signals the presence of eavesdropping.

The security of the BB84 protocol is rooted in two quantum principles: the no-cloning theorem, which prevents Eve from perfectly copying unknown quantum states for her measurement, and the observation that measuring a quantum system generally disturbs it. This disturbance can be detected by Alice and Bob, alerting them to the presence of an eavesdropper.

Quantum cryptography, and BB84 in particular, showcases the potential for quantum technologies to revolutionize secure communication. By harnessing the laws of quantum mechanics, it offers a theoretically unbreakable method for key distribution, laying the groundwork for future secure quantum networks.

Section 6.3 of Chapter 6 delves into the quantum bit commitment, a fundamental protocol in cryptographic systems where one party (Alice) commits to a choice (a bit value) that another party (Bob) cannot know until Alice reveals it. This protocol is crucial for various cryptographic tasks, including secure two-party computation and coin tossing.

In classical cryptography, bit commitment is implemented by Alice writing down her bit on a piece of paper, locking it in a safe, and giving the safe to Bob without the key. Bob knows Alice has committed to her bit because she cannot change it once the safe is locked, yet he cannot know the bit's value until Alice gives him the key.

Quantum bit commitment attempts to use the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve a similar outcome. The idea is that Alice uses quantum states to encode her bit and sends these states to Bob. Due to the quantum no-cloning theorem and the uncertainty principle, Bob cannot determine the committed bit until Alice decides to reveal it by telling him how to measure the quantum state.

However, as explored in this section, creating a perfectly secure quantum bit commitment protocol is highly challenging due to quantum entanglement's properties. Entanglement allows for correlations between quantum states that are stronger than anything possible in classical physics. Alice could exploit this by preparing pairs of entangled qubits, sending one of each pair to Bob while keeping the others. Depending on how she measures her qubits later, she can effectively decide the commitment's outcome at the time of revelation rather than at the time of commitment. This means she can change her committed bit after the fact, violating the security requirements of bit commitment.

The section further examines various attempts and arguments in the quantum information community to find a loophole-free quantum bit commitment protocol. It concludes that due to the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics, particularly entanglement and no-cloning, secure quantum bit commitment is impossible if Alice and Bob do not trust each other. This impossibility result has profound implications for quantum cryptography, suggesting that while quantum mechanics offers new possibilities for secure communication (like quantum key distribution), it also imposes unique limitations.

This discussion on quantum bit commitment illustrates the complex interplay between quantum mechanics and information security, highlighting how quantum principles both enable and restrict cryptographic protocols in ways not encountered in classical cryptography.

Section 6.4, "Quantum Dense Coding," presents a fascinating quantum communication protocol that demonstrates the power of entanglement in transmitting information. The protocol showcases how two classical bits of information can be sent by only transmitting one qubit, under the precondition that the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) share an entangled pair of qubits beforehand.

The dense coding protocol begins with Alice and Bob sharing an entangled pair of qubits in one of the Bell states, for instance, the state $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$. This shared entangled state serves as a quantum channel between Alice and Bob. When Alice wants to send two classical bits of information to Bob, she can manipulate her qubit of the entangled pair in one of four ways, corresponding to the four possible two-bit messages (00, 01, 10, 11). These manipulations include doing nothing (for 00), applying a Pauli X operation (for 01), applying a Pauli Z operation (for 10), or applying both X and Z operations (for 11). Each of these operations transforms the shared Bell state into one of the four orthogonal Bell states, which encode the two bits of information Alice wishes to send.

After Alice performs the operation corresponding to her intended message, she sends her qubit to Bob. Upon receiving Alice's qubit, Bob now has both qubits of the initially entangled pair. Bob can then perform a joint measurement of the two qubits in the Bell basis to determine which of the four Bell states they are in. The outcome of Bob's measurement directly reveals the two-bit message that Alice sent.

The quantum dense coding protocol illustrates the enhanced capacity of quantum channels for information transmission, leveraging the properties of quantum entanglement. In classical communication, sending two bits of information requires two bits to be physically transmitted. However, in quantum dense coding, the pre-existing entangled state between Alice and Bob effectively doubles the capacity of the quantum channel, allowing two bits of information to be communicated by physically sending only one qubit.

This protocol not only highlights the unique features of quantum information but also has potential applications in quantum communication and quantum networking, where the efficient use of quantum channels is crucial. Dense coding, along with other quantum protocols like teleportation and superdense coding, underscores the profound differences between classical and quantum information theory and opens up new possibilities for information processing and transmission in the quantum realm.

Section 6.5, "Teleportation," delves into one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum information science: the ability to transfer the state of a qubit from one location to another without physically transporting the qubit itself. This process, known as quantum teleportation, leverages entanglement and classical communication to achieve what seems, at first glance, to be instantaneous transmission of quantum information across space.

The teleportation protocol is initiated when Alice (the sender) and Bob (the receiver) share a pair of entangled qubits, prepared in a specific state such as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle)$. This shared entangled pair forms the quantum channel over which the teleportation will occur. Alice also possesses a third qubit, the state of which ($|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$) she wishes to teleport to Bob. Crucially, the coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are unknown to Alice, emphasizing that the specific state to be teleported does not need to be known for the protocol to succeed.

The steps of the teleportation protocol are as follows:

1. **Bell State Measurement**: Alice performs a joint measurement on the qubit she wishes to teleport and her part of the entangled pair in the Bell basis. This measurement entangles the two qubits and projects them onto one of the four Bell states. This step irreversibly alters the states of these qubits.

2. **Classical Communication**: The result of Alice's Bell state measurement is two classical bits of information. Alice sends these two bits to Bob using a classical communication channel. The outcome of the measurement tells Bob which of the four possible transformations he needs to apply to his qubit to recover the original state $|\psi\rangle$.

3. **Unitary Transformation**: Upon receiving the classical bits, Bob applies the corresponding unitary operation to his part of the entangled pair. Depending on Alice's message, this could be the identity operation (if Alice's measurement resulted in the original shared entangled state), a bit flip ($X$), a phase flip ($Z$), or both flips ($XZ$).

The beauty of quantum teleportation lies in the fact that the state $|\psi\rangle$ is transferred to Bob's qubit without ever having been physically transmitted through space. Instead, the shared entanglement between Alice and Bob's qubits and the classical information sent by Alice enable Bob to reconstruct the state $|\psi\rangle$ on his qubit.

Quantum teleportation has profound implications for quantum communication and computing. It demonstrates the non-locality of quantum information and provides a fundamental technique for transmitting quantum information over distances. Teleportation is also a critical component in quantum networking and distributed quantum computing, enabling quantum states to be shared across network nodes without direct quantum channels.

This protocol starkly illustrates the power of quantum entanglement and the peculiarities of quantum information, challenging our classical intuitions about the transmission of information and the nature of quantum states.

The following is Appendix A full text. Please give an expanded full explanation on what is being described, foundational math for the subject. 

Appendix A
Vector spaces: basic properties and Dirac notation
In quantum computation the integers from 0 to N are associated with N + 1 orthogonal unit vectors in a vector space of D = N + 1 dimen- sions over the complex numbers. The nature of this association is the subject of Chapter 1. Here we review some of the basic properties of such a vector space, while relating conventional vector-space notation to the Dirac notation used in quantum computer science. Usually the dimension D is a power of 2, but this does not matter for our summary of the basic facts and nomenclature.
In conventional notation such a set of D = N + 1 orthonormal vectors might be denoted by symbols such as φ0, φ1, φ2, . . ., φN. The orthogonality and normalization conditions are expressed in terms of the inner products (φx,φy):

(φx,φy)= 0, x̸=y; (A.1) 1, x=y.
In quantum computation the indices x and y describing the integers associated with the vectors play too important a role to be relegated to tiny fonts in subscripts. Fortunately quantum mechanics employs a notation for vectors, invented by the physicist Paul Dirac, which is well suited for representing such information more prominently. One replaces the symbols φx and φy by |x⟩ and |y⟩, and represents the inner product (φx,φy) by the symbol ⟨x|y⟩. The orthonormality condition (A.1) becomes

⟨x|y⟩ =
0, x ̸= y; (A.2) 1, x=y.
Vectorial character is conveyed by the symbol | ⟩, with the specific
vector being identified by whatever it is that goes between the bent
line ⟩ and the vertical line | . This notational strategy is reminiscent of
the notation for vectors in ordinary three-dimensional physical space
(which we will use here for such vectors) in which vectorial character
is indicated by a horizontal arrow above a symbol denoting the specific
−→
putation for representing generic vectors, but for consistency with the notation for vectors associated with specific integers, and to emphasize their vectorial character, they too are enclosed between a bent line ⟩
vector being referred to: r .
Symbols like φ and ψ remain useful in the notation of quantum com-

 and a vertical line |, becoming |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩. Some mathematicians disapprove of this practice. Why write |ψ⟩, introducing the spurious symbols ⟩ and |, when ψ by itself does the job perfectly well? This gets it backwards. The real point is that the important information – for example the number 7798 – is easier to read in the form |7798⟩ than when presented in small print in the form φ7798. Why introduce in a normal font the often uninformative symbol φ, at the price of demoting the most important information to a mere subscript?
The vector space that describes the operation of a quantum com- puter consists of all linear combinations |ψ ⟩ of the N + 1 orthonormal vectors |x⟩, x = 0, . . ., N, with coefficients αx taken from the complex numbers:

The mathematicians’ preference for writing ψ instead of |ψ⟩ for generic vectors is explicitly acknowledged in the useful convention that |αψ + βφ⟩ is nothing more than an alternative way of writing the
vector α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩:
|αψ + βφ⟩ = α|ψ⟩ + β|φ⟩. (A.4)
In a vector space over the complex numbers the inner product of two general vectors is a complex number satisfying
(u+iv)∗ =u−iv, u,vreal. The inner product is linear in the right-hand vector,
⟨φ|αψ1 + βψ2⟩ = α⟨φ|ψ1⟩ + β⟨φ|ψ2⟩,
and therefore, from (A.5), “anti-linear” in the left-hand vector,
⟨αφ1 + βφ2|ψ⟩ = α∗⟨φ1|ψ⟩ + β∗⟨φ2|ψ⟩.
The inner product of a vector with itself is a real number satisfying
⟨φ|φ⟩ > 0, |φ⟩ ̸= 0. (A.9)
It follows from the orthonormality condition (A.2) that the inner product of the vector |ψ⟩ in (A.3) with another vector
|φ⟩ = β0|0⟩ + β1|1⟩ + · · · + βN|N⟩ =
βx |x⟩ (A.10)

The form (A.12) gives an explicit confirmation of the rule (A.9).
A linear transformation A associates with every vector |ψ⟩ another
vector, called A|ψ⟩, subject to the rule (linearity)
Aα|ψ⟩+β|φ⟩ =αA|ψ⟩+βA|φ⟩. (A.14)
With a nod to the mathematicians, it is notationally useful to define |Aψ⟩ = A|ψ⟩. (A.15)
A linear transformation that preserves the magnitudes of all vectors is called unitary, because it follows from linearity that all magnitudes will be preserved if and only if unit vectors (vectors of magnitude 1) are taken into unit vectors. It also follows from linearity that if a linear transformation U is unitary then it must preserve not only the inner products of arbitrary vectors with themselves, but also the inner products of arbitrary pairs of vectors. This follows straightforwardly for two general vectors |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ from the fact that U preserves the magnitudes of both of them, as well as the magnitudes of the vectors |φ⟩ + |ψ⟩ and |φ⟩ + i|ψ⟩.
One can associate with any given vector |φ⟩ the linear functional that takes every vector |ψ⟩ into the number ⟨φ|ψ⟩. Linearity follows from property (A.7) of the inner product. The set of all such linear functionals is itself a vector space, called the dual space of the original space. The functional associated with the vector α|φ⟩ + β|ψ⟩ is the sum of α∗ times the functional associated with |φ⟩ and β∗ times the functional associated with |ψ⟩. It is an easy exercise to show that any linear functional on the original space is associated with some vector in the dual space. Dirac called vectors in the original space ket vectors and vectors in the dual space bra vectors. He denoted the bra associated with the ket |φ⟩ by the symbol ⟨φ|, so that the symbol ⟨φ|ψ⟩ can equally well be viewed as the inner product of the two kets |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ or as a compact way of expressing the action ⟨φ|(|ψ⟩) of the associated linear

A linear transformation A on the space of ket vectors induces a linear †

⟨Aψ| = ⟨ψ|A†. (A.17)
The operation adjoint to the trivial linear transformation that multiplies by a given complex number is multiplication by the complex conjugate of that number.
It is convenient to extend the dagger notation to the vectors them- selves, defining

of a linear transformation A on kets is a linear transformation on bras, one can also define its action on kets. One does so by requiring that the action of ⟨φ| on A†|ψ⟩ should be equal to the action of ⟨φ|A† on |ψ⟩. This amounts to stipulating that the symbol ⟨φ|A†|ψ⟩ should be unambiguous; it does not matter whether it is read as (⟨φ|A†)|ψ⟩ or as ⟨φ|(A†|ψ⟩). Implicit in this definition is the fact that a vector is completely defined by giving its inner product with all vectors. This in turn follows from the fact that a vector |ψ⟩ can be defined by giving all the amplitudes αx in its expansion (A.3) in thecompleteorthonormalset|x⟩.Butαx =⟨x|ψ⟩.Similarly,alinear operator A is completely defined by giving its matrix elements ⟨φ|A|ψ⟩ for arbitrary pairs of vectors, since the subset ⟨x|A|y⟩ is already enough

A† † = A. (A.24) Since a unitary transformation U preserves inner products, we have ⟨φ|ψ⟩ = ⟨Uφ|Uψ⟩ = ⟨φ|U†U|ψ⟩, (A.25)
and therefore
U†U = 1, (A.26) where 1 is the unit (identity) operator that takes every vector into itself.
It follows from (A.26) that
UU†U = U. (A.27)
In a finite-dimensional vector space a unitary transformation U always takes an orthonormal basis into another orthonormal basis, so any U clearly has a right inverse – the linear transformation that takes the second basis back into the first. Multiplying (A.27) on the right by that inverse tells us that

UU† = 1, (A.28)
soU andUareinversesregardlessoftheorderinwhichtheyact. The vector |ψ ⟩ is an eigenvector of the linear operator A if the action of A on |ψ⟩ is simply to multiply it by a complex number a, called an
A|ψ⟩ = a|ψ⟩. (A.29)
Since the number a can be expressed as a = ⟨ψ |A|ψ ⟩/⟨ψ |ψ ⟩, it follows from (A.23) that if A = A† (such operators are said to be self-adjoint or Hermitian) then a is a real number. Eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are necessarily real.
Since A is Hermitian and a is a real number, it follows from (A.29) (by forming the adjoints of both sides) that
⟨ψ|A = a⟨ψ|, (A.30) so the vector dual to an eigenket of a Hermitian operator is an eigenbra
with the same eigenvalue. It follows immediately that if |φ⟩ is another ′
eigenvector of A with eigenvalue a , then
a⟨ψ|φ⟩ = ⟨ψ|A|φ⟩ = a′⟨ψ|φ⟩, (A.31)

It can be shown that for any Hermitian operator A, one can choose an orthonormal basis for the entire D-dimensional space whose members are eigenvectors of A. The basis is unique if and only if all the D eigenvalues of A are distinct. In the contrary case (in which A is said to be degenerate) one can pick arbitrary orthonormal bases within each of the subspaces spanned by eigenvectors of A with the same eigenvalue. More generally, if A,B,C,... are mutually commuting Hermitian operators then one can choose an orthonormal basis whose members are eigenstates of every one of them.

In particular, since a unitary transformation U satisfies UU† = U†U = 1, one can choose an orthonormal basis consisting of eigenvectors of U. Since unitary transformations preserve the magnitudes of vectors, the eigenvalues of U must be complex numbers of modulus 1. In the quantum theory such complex numbers are often called phase factors.
Given two vector spaces of dimensions D1 and D2, and given any two vectors |ψ1⟩ and |ψ2⟩ in the two spaces, one associates with each such pair a tensor product |ψ1⟩ ⊗ |ψ2⟩ (often the tensor-product sign ⊗ is omitted) which is bilinear:
|ψ ⟩⊗ α|ψ ⟩+β|φ ⟩ =α|ψ ⟩⊗|ψ ⟩+β|ψ ⟩⊗|φ ⟩, 1221212
(A.32)
With the further rule that |ψ1⟩ ⊗ |ψ2⟩ = |φ1⟩ ⊗ |φ2⟩ only if |φ1⟩ and |φ2⟩ are scalar multiples of |ψ1⟩ and |ψ2⟩, one easily sees that the set of all tensor products of vectors from the two spaces forms a vector space of dimension D1 D2.
One defines the inner product of |ψ1⟩ ⊗ |ψ2⟩ with |φ1⟩ ⊗ |φ2⟩ to be the ordinary product ⟨ψ1|φ1⟩⟨ψ2|φ2⟩ of the inner products in the two original spaces. Given orthonormal bases for each of the two spaces, the set of tensor products of all pairs of vectors from the two bases forms an orthonormal basis for the tensor-product space. If A1 and A2 are linear operators on the two spaces, one defines the tensor-product operator A1 ⊗ A2 to satisfy
A ⊗A |ψ⟩⊗|ψ⟩ =|Aψ⟩⊗|Aψ⟩= A|ψ⟩ ⊗ A|ψ⟩, 121211221122
(A.33)
and easily shows that it can be extended to a linear operator on the entire tensor-product space.
α|ψ ⟩+β|φ ⟩ ⊗|ψ ⟩ = α|ψ ⟩⊗|ψ ⟩+β|φ ⟩⊗|ψ ⟩. 1121212

All of this generalizes in the obvious way to n-fold tensor products of n vector spaces.
If A is a linear operator whose eigenvectors constitute an orthonor- †
malbasis–i.e.ifAisHermitianor,moregenerally,ifAandA com- mute – and if f is a function taking complex numbers to complex numbers, then one can define f (A) by specifying that each eigenvector |φ⟩ of A, in the basis with eigenvalue a, is also an eigenvector of f (A) with eigenvalue f (a). This defines f (A) on a basis, and it can therefore be extended to arbitrary vectors by requiring it to be linear. It follows from this definition that if f (z) is a polynomial or convergent power series in z then f (A) is the corresponding polynomial or convergent power series in A.
In Dirac notation one defines the outer product of two vectors |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ to be the linear operator, denoted by |φ⟩⟨ψ|, that takes any vector |γ ⟩ into |φ⟩ multiplied by the inner product ⟨ψ|γ ⟩:
|φ⟩⟨ψ| |γ ⟩ = |φ⟩ ⟨ψ|γ ⟩ . (A.34)
As is always the case with Dirac notation, the point is to define things in such a way that the evaluation of an ambiguous expression such as |φ⟩⟨ψ|γ ⟩ does not depend on how you read it; the notation is designed always to enforce the associative law.
Note that |ψ⟩⟨ψ| is the projection operator onto the one- dimensional subspace spanned by the unit vector |ψ⟩; i.e. any vector |γ ⟩ can be written as the sum of a vector |γ ⟩∥ in the one-dimensional subspace and a vector |γ ⟩⊥ perpendicular to the one-dimensional sub- space, and
|ψ⟩⟨ψ| |γ ⟩ = |γ ⟩∥. (A.35)
Similarly, if one has a set of orthonormal vectors |ψi⟩ then
|ψi ⟩⟨ψi | projects onto the subspace spanned by all the |ψi ⟩. If the orthonormal set is a complete orthonormal set – for example |x⟩, x = 0, . . ., N – then the set spans the entire vector space and the projection operator is the unit operator 1:
N
|x⟩⟨x| = 1. (A.36)
x=0
This trivial identity can be surprisingly helpful. Any vector |ψ ⟩, for
i
example, satisfies
|ψ⟩ = 1|ψ⟩ =
|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩, (A.37)
which tells us that the amplitudes αx appearing in the expansion (A.3) of |ψ⟩ are just the inner products ⟨x|ψ⟩. Similarly, any linear operator

(A.38) which reveals the matrix elements ⟨x|A|y⟩ to be the expansion co- efficients of the operator A in the “operator basis” |x⟩⟨y|. And note
that
⟨x|AB|y⟩ = ⟨x|A1B|y⟩ =
⟨x|A|z⟩⟨z|B|y⟩, (A.39)
which gives the familiar matrix-multiplication rule for constructing the matrix of a product out of the matrix elements of the individual operators.
If you prefer to think of vectors in terms of their components in a specific basis, then you might note that the (ket) vector |ψ⟩, with the expansion (A.3) with amplitudes αx in the orthonormal basis |x⟩, can be represented by a column vector:

Appendix A provides a foundational overview of vector spaces, emphasizing their role in quantum computation and introducing Dirac notation, a standard mathematical framework used in quantum mechanics. Here's an expanded explanation and foundational math for the subjects described:

### Vector Spaces and Dirac Notation

Quantum computation models information using vectors within high-dimensional spaces, typically over the complex numbers. Each possible state of a quantum bit (qubit) corresponds to a unit vector within this space. The dimensionality of the space is directly related to the number of qubits, with $N+1$ orthogonal unit vectors spanning a space of dimension $D = N + 1$, where $N$ is the number of qubits.

#### Orthonormality

Orthonormal vectors $\{\phi_0, \phi_1, ..., \phi_N\}$ satisfy two conditions: orthogonality ($\langle \phi_x, \phi_y \rangle = 0$ for $x \neq y$) and normalization ($\langle \phi_x, \phi_x \rangle = 1$). Dirac notation simplifies these expressions using kets $|x\rangle$ and bras $\langle x|$ for vectors and their duals, respectively, with the inner product written as $\langle x|y \rangle$.

#### Vector Representation and Linear Combinations

A quantum state can be represented as a linear combination of basis vectors, $| \psi \rangle = \sum_{x=0}^{N} \alpha_x |x\rangle$, with complex coefficients $\alpha_x$ representing the probability amplitudes. The inner product between two states $|\psi\rangle$ and $|\phi\rangle$ is a complex number, reflecting the probability amplitude of transitioning from one state to another.

#### Unitary Transformations

Unitary transformations, essential for quantum operations, preserve the inner products and hence the overall quantum state's probability structure. A unitary operator $U$ satisfies $U^\dagger U = UU^\dagger = I$, where $U^\dagger$ is the adjoint (conjugate transpose) of $U$, and $I$ is the identity operator.

#### Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Eigenvectors $|\psi\rangle$ of an operator $A$ satisfy $A|\psi\rangle = a|\psi\rangle$, where $a$ is the eigenvalue. For Hermitian operators (self-adjoint), eigenvalues are real, and eigenvectors associated with different eigenvalues are orthogonal.

#### Tensor Products

The tensor product $|\psi_1\rangle \otimes |\psi_2\rangle$ represents the combined state of two quantum systems. It's bilinear and extends to define the state of multi-qubit systems. The space resulting from the tensor product of two vector spaces has a dimension equal to the product of the dimensions of the two spaces.

#### Outer Products

The outer product $| \phi \rangle \langle \psi |$ defines a matrix or operator from two vectors, which is useful for creating projection operators and representing quantum gates in matrix form.

### Mathematical Foundation

Quantum mechanics and quantum computation heavily rely on complex vector spaces, linear algebra, and the principles of superposition and entanglement. Dirac notation is particularly suited for expressing quantum states, transformations, and measurements due to its clear representation of the quantum system's underlying Hilbert space structure.

This appendix serves as a crucial mathematical foundation for understanding quantum algorithms, quantum gates, and the overall behavior of quantum systems in computation, providing the necessary tools for exploring more complex quantum phenomena and algorithms.

Structure of the general 1-Qbit unitary transformation
I describe here some relations among Pauli matrices, 1-Qbit unitary transformations, and rotations of real-space three-dimensional vectors. The relations are of fundamental importance in many applications of quantum mechanics, and are an essential part of the intellectual equip- ment of anybody wanting to understand the mathematical structure of three-dimensional rotations. The reason for mentioning them here is that they can also make certain circuit identities quite transparent. The quantum-computation literature contains some unnecessarily cumber- some derivations of many such identities, suggesting that these useful mathematical facts deserve to be more widely known in the field.

for some complex number u0 and 3-vector u with complex compo- nents ux,uy, and uz. Here −→σ represents the “3-vector” whose com- ponents are the Pauli matrices σx, σy, and σz, so in expanded form (B.2) reads

A remarkable connection between these two-dimensional unitary matrices and ordinary three-dimensional rotations emerges from the fact that each of the three Pauli matrices in (B.1) has zero trace, and that the operator unitary transformation
A → uAu† (B.14)
preserves the trace of A.1
Note first that if −→a is a real vector then u(−→a · −→σ )u† is Hermitian
and can therefore be expressed as a linear combination of 1 and the
three Pauli matrices with real coefficients. Since σx, σy, and σz all
have zero trace, so does −→a · −→σ and therefore so does u(−→a · −→σ )u†.
Its expansion as a linear combination of 1 and the three Pauli matrices −→′ −→ −→′
must therefore be of the form a · σ for some real vector a (since 1 alone among the four matrices has nonzero trace):

to real 3-vectors a induced by any two-dimensional unitary u through (B.15) is a rotation:
−→′ −→
a =Rua. (B.19)
Furthermore, by applying the (unitary) product uv of two unitary

The three-dimensional rotations arrived at in this way are all proper (i.e. they preserve rather than invert handedness) because they can all be continuously connected to the identity. Any proper rotation can be associated with a u, and in just two different ways (u and −u clearly being associated with the same rotation). The choice of phase leading

172 APPENDIX B
 to the general form (B.10) with real u0 can be imposed by requiring that the determinant of u must be 1, so in mathematical language we have a 2-to-1 homomorphism from the group SU(2) of unimodular unitary two-dimensional matrices to the group SO(3) of proper three- dimensional rotations.
Although this may all seem tediously abstract, it is surprisingly useful at a very practical level. It can reduce some highly nontriv- ial three-dimensional geometry to elementary algebra, just as Euler’s relation e i φ = cos φ + i sin φ reduces some slightly nontrivial two- dimensional trigonometry to simple algebra. Suppose, for example,
that you combine a rotation through an angle α about an axis given

Notethat(B.26)and(B.27)aretriviallycorrectwhen a and b are parallel. A little geometrical thought reveals that they are also correct when α and β are both 180◦. To try to see geometrically why they are correct more generally is to acquire a deep appreciation for the remarkable power of the representation of three-dimensional rotations in terms of two-dimensional unitary transformations. Other examples of the power of the representation are illustrated in the derivations of circuit identities in Section 2.6, in the characterization of the general 1-Qbit state in Appendix C, and in the construction of the Hardy state in Appendix D.

Appendix B delves into the mathematical intricacies that relate one-qubit unitary transformations to rotations in three-dimensional space, utilizing Pauli matrices. This relationship not only underpins much of quantum mechanics but also offers a streamlined method to understand circuit identities within quantum computing. Here's a detailed explanation and foundational math for this appendix:

### Pauli Matrices and Unitary Transformations

Pauli matrices ($\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, $\sigma_z$) and the identity matrix ($I$) form a basis for all 2x2 matrices. Any two-dimensional matrix $u$ can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of these matrices:

$$u = u_0 I + \vec{u} \cdot \vec{\sigma}$$

where $u_0$ is a complex number and $\vec{u} = (u_x, u_y, u_z)$ is a complex vector.

### Conditions for Unitarity

For $u$ to be unitary (meaning $u u^\dagger = u^\dagger u = I$), it must satisfy certain conditions derived from its expansion in terms of Pauli matrices. Importantly, $u_0$ must be real, and $\vec{u}$ must essentially be a purely imaginary vector times a real vector, leading to the general form of a unitary transformation as:

$$u = u_0 I + i \vec{v} \cdot \vec{\sigma}$$

where $u_0$ is real, and $\vec{v}$ is a real vector, satisfying $u_0^2 + |\vec{v}|^2 = 1$.

### Rotation in Three-Dimensional Space

The key insight of Appendix B is that a one-qubit unitary transformation corresponds to a rotation in three-dimensional space. Specifically, the unitary matrix:

$$u = \exp(i \gamma \vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma})$$

represents a rotation around the real unit vector $\vec{n}$ by an angle $2\gamma$. This is because the square of $\vec{n} \cdot \vec{\sigma}$ equals the identity matrix, allowing the exponential of a Pauli vector to be directly related to the sine and cosine of the rotation angle.

### Trace Preservation and Rotation Properties

The operation $A \rightarrow u A u^\dagger$ preserves the trace of $A$, which, along with the hermitian nature of $\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z$, implies that the transformation $u(\vec{a} \cdot \vec{\sigma})u^\dagger$ corresponds to a real-space rotation. This results in a linear, real, and inner-product-preserving transformation of the vector $\vec{a}$, essentially defining a rotation.

### Mathematical Representation of Rotations

By analyzing the unitary transformations using Pauli matrices, complex rotations in three-dimensional space can be algebraically simplified. This approach not only offers a more intuitive understanding of quantum rotations but also significantly simplifies the derivation of quantum circuit identities.

### Practical Applications

This mathematical framework is instrumental in quantum computing for devising and understanding circuit identities, characterizing qubit states, and constructing specific quantum states such as the Hardy state. The ability to represent three-dimensional rotations with two-dimensional unitary matrices highlights the elegance and power of quantum mechanics' mathematical structure, offering a compact and efficient way to describe and manipulate quantum information.

In summary, Appendix B provides a profound connection between the algebra of qubit operations and the geometry of spatial rotations, underscoring the deep interplay between quantum mechanics and classical vector algebra. This connection not only enriches the theoretical understanding of quantum operations but also facilitates practical computations and manipulations within the realm of quantum computing.

Appendix C
Structure of the general 1-Qbit state
The 1-Qbit computational-basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ can be characterized to within an overall phase by the fact that they are eigenstates of the number operator n with eigenvalues 0 and 1 or, equivalently, that they are eigenstates of 1 − 2n = Z = −→z · −→σ with eigenvalues 1 and −1.
Let |φ⟩ be any 1-Qbit state, and let |ψ⟩ be the orthogonal state (unique to within an overall phase), satisfying ⟨ψ|φ⟩ = 0. Since |0⟩ and |1⟩ are linearly independent there is a unique linear transformation taking them into |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩. But since |φ⟩ and |ψ⟩ are an orthonormal pair (as are |0⟩ and |1⟩) this linear transformation preserves the inner product of arbitrary pairs of states, so it is a unitary transformation u.
Since
|φ⟩ = u|0⟩, |ψ⟩ = u|1⟩, (C.1)

n′|φ⟩ = 0, n′|ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩. (C.2)

For Qbits that are not spins, the richness lies in the possibility of applying an arbitrary unitary transformation to each Qbit, before measuring it in the computational basis. What makes spins special is that applying the unitary transfor- mation to the Qbits (which is not always that easy to arrange) can be replaced by straightforwardly applying the corresponding rotation to every 1-Qbit measurement gate.

Appendix C delves into the foundational aspects of a one-qubit (1-Qbit) state in quantum computing, providing a clear framework for understanding the generality of qubit states beyond the computational basis states $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$. Here's an expanded explanation and foundational math:

### Basics of Qubit States
A qubit is the quantum counterpart of a classical bit. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition state, representing both 0 and 1 simultaneously, to varying degrees. The computational basis states, $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$, are often chosen as the standard basis for qubits due to their simplicity and direct analogy to classical bits. These basis states can be defined as eigenstates of the Pauli $Z$ operator ($Z = \vec{z} \cdot \vec{\sigma}$), with eigenvalues $+1$ and $-1$, respectively.

### Unitary Transformation and General Qubit States
Any 1-Qbit state $|\phi\rangle$ can be obtained from the computational basis states through a unitary transformation, denoted by $u$. A unitary transformation preserves the inner product, making it an essential tool for manipulating qubit states without altering their probabilities.

Given $|\phi\rangle$ as a general qubit state, there exists an orthogonal state $|\psi\rangle$ (unique up to an overall phase) such that $|\phi\rangle$ and $|\psi\rangle$ form an orthonormal pair. The transformation from $|0\rangle, |1\rangle$ to $|\phi\rangle, |\psi\rangle$ is unitary, implying that any pair of orthogonal qubit states can serve as a basis for quantum computation, much like $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.

### Mathematical Representation
The unitary transformation that takes $|0\rangle$ to $|\phi\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ to $|\psi\rangle$ can be represented as:
$$|\phi\rangle = u|0\rangle, \quad |\psi\rangle = u|1\rangle$$

This unitary transformation, associated with a rotation $R(\vec{m}, \theta)$, implies that the qubit number operator $n'$ in the transformed basis ($|\phi\rangle, |\psi\rangle$) is related to the computational basis number operator $n$ by:
$$n' = unu^\dagger = \frac{1}{2}(1 - \vec{z}' \cdot \vec{\sigma})$$

where $\vec{z}' = R(\vec{m}, \theta)\vec{z}$ represents the rotation of the original z-axis to align with the new basis.

### Physical Interpretation
The flexibility in choosing qubit basis states reflects the quantum mechanical principle that measurement outcomes depend on the measurement basis. For systems like atomic magnets (spins), this flexibility manifests in the ability to measure magnetization along any direction, with the system collapsing to a state aligned or anti-aligned with that direction. This contrasts with classical bits (Cbits), which have a fixed measurement outcome.

### Implications for Quantum Computing
The ability to use any pair of orthogonal states as the computational basis, and to measure qubits in arbitrary bases via unitary transformations or physical rotations, underlines the versatility and power of quantum computing. It highlights the fundamental difference between quantum and classical information processing: the richness of quantum states and transformations enables complex computations and information encoding in ways not possible with classical bits.

In summary, Appendix C elucidates the structure of general 1-Qbit states, demonstrating the universality and adaptability of qubit bases through unitary transformations. This foundational concept is pivotal for quantum computing, offering insights into qubit manipulation, quantum measurement, and the broader implications for quantum information theory.

Appendix D
Spooky action at a distance
As a further exercise in applying the quantum-computational formal- ism to Qbits, and as a subject of interest in itself, though not directly related to quantum computation, I describe here a thought-provoking state of affairs illustrated with an example discovered by Lucien Hardy. (Similar thoughts are provoked by an example discovered by Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger, described in Sec- tion 6.6.)
Suppose that Alice and Bob each has one member of a pair of Qbits, which have been prepared in the 2-Qbit state
|⟩ = √1 3|00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩ − |11⟩ . (D.1) 12
A specification of how to prepare two Qbits in such a Hardy state, somewhat more transparent than the general procedure described in Section 1.11, is given after the extraordinary properties of the Hardy state are described. One easily verifies that the state |⟩ can also be written as
|⟩=√1 2|00⟩−HaHb|11⟩, (D.2) 3
where we take Ha to act on the left (Alice’s) Qbit and Hb to act on the right (Bob’s) Qbit. Note the following four elementary properties of a pair of Qbits in the state |⟩.
(i) If Alice and Bob each measures their own Qbit, then (D.1) shows
that there is a nonzero probability ( 1 ) that both get the result 1. 12
(ii) If Alice and Bob each applies a Hadamard to their own Qbit then, since H2 = 1, the state (D.2) of the Qbits becomes
HaHb|⟩= √1 2HaHb|00⟩−|11⟩ = √1 |00⟩+|01⟩+|10⟩ , 33
(D.3) so if they measure their Qbits after each has applied a Hadamard, then
the probability that both get the value 1 is zero.
(iii) If only Alice applies a Hadamard to her Qbit, then the state
(D.2) of the two Qbits becomes
Ha|⟩=√1 2Ha|00⟩−Hb|11⟩. (D.4) 3
Since Ha |00⟩ is a linear combination of |00⟩ and |10⟩, and since Hb |11⟩ is a linear combination of |10⟩ and |11⟩, the state |01⟩ does not appear
175
176 APPENDIX D
 Table D.1. Four ways to measure two Qbits in the Hardy state (D.1)
Gates Result Possible? Alice Bob Alice Bob
1 1 1 1 Yes 1 H 1 0 No H 1 0 1 No H H 1 1 No
in the expansion of Ha |⟩ in computational-basis states. So when the Qbits are subsequently measured the probability is zero that Alice will get the value 0 and Bob the value 1.
(iv) If only Bob applies a Hadamard to his Qbit, then by the same reasoning (except for the interchange of Alice and Bob) when the Qbits are subsequently measured the probability is zero that Alice will get the value 1 and Bob the value 0.
Taken together, these four cases seem to have some very strange implications. The cases are summarized in the four rows of Table D.1 above. On the left is indicated whether (H) or not (1) Alice or Bob sends their Qbit through a Hadamard gate before sending it through a measurement gate. In the center is listed the measurement outcome of interest for each case. The column on the right specifies whether that outcome can or cannot occur for that particular case.
To see what is strange, suppose that Alice and Bob each indepen-
dently decides, by tossing coins, whether or not to apply a Hadamard
to their Qbit before sending it through a measurement gate. There is
a nonzero probability (1 × 1 = 1 ) that neither applies a Hadamard 4 12 48
and both measurement gates show 1 (see the first row of Table D.1). In the one time in 48 that this happens, it is tempting to conclude that each Qbit was, even before the coins were tossed, capable of producing a 1 when directly subjected to a measurement gate because, after all, each Qbit did produce a 1 when directly subjected to a measurement gate.
But if Alice’s Qbit did indeed have such a capability, then, in the absence of spooky interactions between Bob’s Hadamard and Alice’s Qbit, her Qbit surely would have retained that capability, even if Bob’s coin had come up the other way and he had applied a Hadamard to his own Qbit before measuring it. But if Alice’s Qbit was indeed ca- pable of registering a 1 when measured directly, then Bob’s Qbit must have been incapable of registering a 0 if measured after a Hadamard, since (see the second row of Table D.1) when Bob applies a Hadamard before his measurement and Alice does not, it is impossible for Bob’s measurement to give 0 while Alice’s gives 1.
       
By the same reasoning (interchanging Alice and Bob and referring to the third row of Table D.1) we conclude that Alice’s Qbit must also have been incapable of registering a 0 when measured after a Hadamard.
So in each of the slightly more than 2% of the cases in which neither Alice nor Bob applies Hadamards and both their measurement gates register 1, we conclude that if the tosses of both coins had come out the other way and both had applied Hadamards before measuring, then neither Qbit could have registered 0 when measured: both would have had to register 1. But according to the fourth row of Table D.1 this can never happen.
Although this particular argument was discovered by Lucien Hardy only in the early 1990s, similar situations (where the paradox is not as directly evident) have been known since a famous paper by John Bell appeared in 1964. Over the years passions have run high on the significance of this. Some claim that it shows that the value Alice or Bob finds upon measuring her or his Qbit does depend on whether or not the other, who, with his or her Qbit, could be far away, does or does not apply a Hadamard to his or her own Qbit before measuring it. They call this “quantum nonlocality” or “spooky action at a distance”– a translation of Einstein’s disparaging spukhafte Fernwirkungen.
My own take on it is rather different. With any given pair of Qbits, Alice and Bob each either does or does not apply a Hadamard prior to their measurement. Only one of the four possible cases is actually realized. The other three cases do not happen. In a deterministic world it can make sense to talk about what would have happened if things had been other than the way they actually were, since the hypothetical situation can entail unique subsequent behavior. But in the intrinsically nondeterminstic case of measuring Qbits, one cannot infer, from what Alice’s Qbit actually did, that it has a “capability” to do what it actually did, which it retains even in a hypothetical situation that did not, in fact, take place. To characterize the possible behavior of Alice’s Qbit in a fictitious world requires more than just the irrelevance of Bob’s decision whether or not to apply a Hadamard. It also requires that whatever it is that actually is relevant to Alice’s outcome remains the same in both worlds and plays the same role in bringing about that outcome. But the reading of a measurement gate has an irreducible randomness to it: nothing need play a role in bringing it about.1
The real lesson here is that if one has a single pair of Qbits and various choices of gates to apply to them before sending them through a measurement gate, then it makes no sense to infer, from the actual
1 Conscience requires me to report here the existence of a small deviant subculture of physicists, known as Bohmians, who maintain that there is a deterministic substructure, unfortunately inaccessible to us, that underlies quantum phenomena. Needless to say, all Bohmians believe in real instantaneous action at a distance.
APPENDIX D 177
  
178 APPENDIX D
 outcome of the measurement for the actual choice of gates, additional constraints, going beyond those implied by the initial state of the Qbits, on the hypothetical outcomes of measurements in the fictional case in which one made a different choice of gates. It is nonsense to insist that Alice’s Qbit has to retain the “capability” to do what it actually did, if we imagine turning back the clock and doing it over again. Assigning a “capability” to Alice’s Qbit prior to the measurement is rather like assigning it a state. But the pre-measurement state (D.1) is an entangled state, so Alice’s Qbit has no state of its own.
One can, however, let Alice and Bob repeatedly play this game with many different pairs of Qbits, always preparing the Qbits in the same initial 2-Qbit state (D.1). It is then entirely sensible to ask whether the statistics of the values Bob finds upon measuring his Qbit depend on whether Alice applied a Hadamard transform to her Qbit. For Alice and Bob can accumulate a mass of data, and directly compare the statistics Bob got when Alice applied the Hadamard with those he got when she did not. If Bob got a different statistical distribution of readings depending on whether Alice did or did not apply a Hadamard to her faraway Qbit before she measured it, this would permit nonspooky action at a distance which could actually be used to send messages. So it is important to note that Bob’s statistics do not, in fact, depend on whether or not Alice applies a Hadamard.
We can show this under quite general conditions. Suppose that n Qbits are divided into two subsets, each of which may be indepen- dently manipulated (i.e. subjected to unitary transformations) prior to a measurement. Let the na Qbits on the left constitute one such group and the nb = n − na on the right, the other. Think of the first group as under the control of Alice and the second as belonging to Bob. If the n Qbits are always prepared in the state |⟩, then if Alice and Bob separately measure their Qbits, the Born rule tells us that the joint probability p(x, y) of Alice getting x and Bob y is
p (x, y) = ⟨|Pa Pb |⟩, (D.5) xy
where the projection operator Pa acts only on Alice’s Qbits (i.e. it acts as the identity on Bob’s) and Pb only on Bob’s.
Suppose, now, that Alice acts on her Qbits with the unitary transfor- mation Ua before making her measurement and Bob acts on his with Ub . Then the state |⟩ is changed into
|⟩ = UaUb|⟩. (D.6)
Now the probability of their measurements giving x and y, conditioned on their choices of unitary transformation, is
!!
p(x,y|Ua,Ub)= |PaPb| = |U†U† PaPb UaUb| xy baxy
=|U†PaUa U†PbUb| ax by
!
(D.7)

(where we have used the fact that all operators that act only on Alice’s Qbits commute with all operators that act only on Bob’s).
It follows from the fact that
U†PaUa =U† Pa Ua =U†1Ua =1 (D.8)

that Bob’s marginal statistics do not depend on what Alice chose to do to her own Qbits:
axaxa xx
p(x,y|Ua,Ub)=⟨| U†PbUb |⟩=p(y|Ub), by
x
(D.9) which does not depend on the particular unitary transformation Ua chosen by Alice. Therefore the statistics of the measurement outcomes
for any group of Qbits are not altered by anything done to other Qbits (provided, of course, that the other Qbits do not subsequently interact with those in the original group, for example by the application of appropriate 2-Qbit gates).
Like any 2-Qbit state, the state (D.1) leading to this remarkable set of data can be constructed with a single cNOT gate and three 1-Qbit unitary gates. Here is a construction that is somewhat more direct than the general construction given in Section 1.11. It exploits the connec- tion between 1-Qbit unitary transformations and three-dimensional rotations developed in Appendix B.
It follows from (D.3) that

Appendix D explores a profound aspect of quantum mechanics known as "spooky action at a distance," illustrated through a thought experiment involving a specific quantum state known as the Hardy state. This appendix not only delves into the peculiarities of quantum entanglement but also challenges our classical intuitions about locality and causality. Here's a comprehensive detailed summary:

### The Hardy State
The Hardy state, a specific quantum state of two qubits (Alice's and Bob's), is given by:
$$|\Psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|00\rangle + |01\rangle + |10\rangle) - |11\rangle$$

This state showcases several counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, particularly quantum entanglement and nonlocality.

### Properties and Implications
The appendix highlights four key observations (i-iv) about the outcomes of measurements performed on the qubits in the Hardy state, depending on whether Alice or Bob applies a Hadamard gate before their measurement:

1. **Nonzero probability of both measuring 1**: Direct measurement can yield both qubits in the state |1⟩ with nonzero probability.
2. **Zero probability of both measuring 1 after Hadamards**: Applying a Hadamard gate to both qubits before measurement makes it impossible for both to measure |1⟩.
3. **Influence of a single Hadamard**: If only one party (Alice or Bob) applies a Hadamard, certain outcomes become impossible, illustrating how the actions of one party affect the possible outcomes of measurements performed by the other.
4. **Summarized in Table D.1**: A table in the appendix encapsulates these possibilities, showing how the probability of certain outcomes changes based on the actions (applying a Hadamard gate or not) of Alice and Bob.

### Quantum Nonlocality
The appendix delves into the paradoxical implications of these properties, highlighting a form of "quantum nonlocality" or "spooky action at a distance." If Alice and Bob decide randomly whether to apply a Hadamard gate before measuring, the outcomes suggest that the measurement result of one qubit seems to depend on whether a Hadamard gate was applied to the other qubit, even if they are spatially separated. This challenges classical notions of locality and causality.

### Interpretations and Significance
The observations about the Hardy state bring to light the non-deterministic nature of quantum mechanics, emphasizing that outcomes of quantum measurements cannot always be thought of as revealing pre-existing properties. The appendix argues that in a quantum world, it doesn't always make sense to talk about what would have happened under different experimental conditions, highlighting the difference between deterministic classical physics and the probabilistic nature of quantum physics.

Furthermore, it's clarified that while individual measurements on entangled qubits might suggest "spooky" influences at a distance, statistical properties of ensembles of such measurements (e.g., over many pairs of qubits prepared in the same entangled state) do not allow for faster-than-light communication or any form of "action at a distance" that would violate relativity.

### Construction of the Hardy State
The appendix concludes by providing a method to prepare the Hardy state using quantum gates, demonstrating the practical aspect of translating theoretical quantum states into physical experiments. This not only solidifies the conceptual discussion with a concrete example but also illustrates the interplay between quantum theory and practical quantum computing, including the use of unitary transformations and quantum gates.

In summary, Appendix D presents a fascinating exploration of quantum entanglement and nonlocality through the Hardy state, challenging classical intuitions and underscoring the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.

Appendix E
Consistency of the generalized Born rule
A general state of m + n Qbits can be written as
|⟩m+n =
αxy|x⟩m|y⟩n.
(E.1)
p(x) =
x,y
The most general form of the Born rule asserts that if just the m Qbits associated with the states |x⟩m in (E.1) are measured, then with probability
|αxy|2 (E.2) the result will be x, and after the measurement the state of all m + n
Qbits will be the product state
|x⟩m|x⟩n, (E.3)
where the (correctly normalized) state of the n unmeasured Qbits is given by
|x⟩n = √ 1 αxy|y⟩n. (E.4) p(x) y
This strongest form of the Born rule satisfies the reasonable con- sistency requirement that measuring r Qbits and then immediately measuring s more, before any other gates have had a chance to act, is equivalent to measuring all the r + s Qbits together. An important consequence is that an n-Qbit measurement gate can be constructed by applying n 1-Qbit measurement gates to the n individual Qbits, as illustrated in Figure 1.8.
To establish this consistency condition, write the state of r + s + u Qbits as
y
 αxyz|x⟩r|y⟩s|z⟩u. (E.5)
If the r + s Qbits are all measured together then a direct application of the rule tells us that the result will be xy with probability
|⟩n =
x,y,z
p(xy) =
|αxyz|2, (E.6)
z
181
182 APPENDIX E
 and that the post-measurement state of the Qbits will be |x⟩r|y⟩s|xy⟩u =|x⟩r|y⟩s √ 1 αxyz|z⟩u. (E.7)
p(xy) z
On the other hand if just the first r Qbits are measured then the rule tells us that the result will be x with probability
 |αxyz|2, and that the post-measurement state will be
|x⟩r|x⟩s+u =|x⟩r √1 αxyz|y⟩s|z⟩u. p(x) y,z
p(x) =
(E.8)
(E.9)
y,z
 Given that the result of the first measurement is x, so that the post- measurement state is (E.9), a further application of the rule tells us that if the next s Qbits are measured, the result will be y with probability

  2
αxyz/ p(x) , (E.10)
p(y|x) =
and that the post-measurement state after the second measurement
will be
where
|x⟩r|y⟩s|xy⟩u, (E.11) |xy⟩u = √ 1 √1 αxyz|z⟩u. (E.12)
z
   p(y|x) p(x) z
Since the joint probability of getting x and then getting y is related
to the conditional probability p(y|x) by
p(xy) = p(x)p(y|x), (E.13)
this final state and probability are exactly the same as the probability (E.6) and final state (E.7) associated with a direct measurement of all r + s Qbits.

Appendix E delves into the intricacies of the generalized Born rule in quantum mechanics, focusing on the consistency of this rule across different measurement scenarios. This appendix not only reinforces the foundational principles of quantum measurements but also emphasizes the operational coherence that underpins quantum theory. Here’s a detailed summary:

### Generalized Born Rule
The Born rule is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, providing the probability of measuring specific outcomes for a quantum system. In the context of multiple qubits, the generalized Born rule extends this principle to complex systems composed of m + n qubits, where a subset of these qubits can be measured, influencing the state of the entire system.

### Measurement Probability and Post-measurement State
The rule asserts that if only m out of m + n qubits are measured, the probability of obtaining a specific outcome x is determined by the squared magnitude of the coefficients $|\alpha_{xy}|^2$, where $\alpha_{xy}$ are the coefficients linking the measured qubits' states $|x\rangle_m$ with the states $|y\rangle_n$ of the unmeasured qubits. Following this measurement, the entire system transitions into a product state $|x\rangle_m|\Psi_x\rangle_n$, where $|\Psi_x\rangle_n$ is a normalized state of the n unmeasured qubits conditioned on the measurement outcome x.

### Consistency Requirement
A critical aspect of the generalized Born rule is its consistency across sequential measurements. Measuring a set of qubits and then immediately measuring additional qubits should yield the same outcome as measuring all selected qubits in a single step. This requirement ensures the rule's operational coherence, affirming that the quantum state evolution during measurements adheres to the probabilistic framework dictated by the Born rule.

### Constructing Multi-qubit Measurement Gates
An important consequence of this consistency is the ability to construct an n-qubit measurement gate using individual 1-qubit measurement gates. This modular approach to measurements in quantum computing simplifies the design and analysis of quantum circuits, aligning with the principle that quantum measurements can be decomposed into sequences of simpler operations without altering the measurement outcomes.

### Demonstration of Consistency
The appendix demonstrates the consistency condition through a detailed example involving r + s + u qubits, showing that the probabilities and post-measurement states resulting from sequential measurements of subsets of qubits align with those obtained from a simultaneous measurement of all qubits in the selected subsets. This demonstration not only validates the generalized Born rule's internal consistency but also illustrates its practical applicability in quantum computing scenarios, where measurements are a fundamental operation.

### Summary
Appendix E provides a rigorous examination of the generalized Born rule, highlighting its pivotal role in quantum measurement theory and quantum computing. By establishing the rule's consistency across different measurement arrangements, it reinforces the theoretical foundation underlying quantum mechanics' probabilistic nature, ensuring the logical coherence of quantum state measurements and their consequences on quantum systems' evolution.

Appendix F
Other aspects of Deutsch’s problem
Suppose that one attempted to solve Deutsch’s problem, not by the trick that does the job in Chapter 2, but by doing the standard thing: starting with input and output registers in the state |0⟩|0⟩, applying a Hadamard to the input register, and then using the one application of Uf toassociatewiththetwoQbitsthestate
|ψ⟩ = √1 |0⟩| f (0)⟩ + √1 |1⟩| f (1)⟩. (F.1) 22
A direct measurement of both Qbits reveals the value of f at either 0 or 1 (randomly), but gives no information whatever about the question under investigation, whether or not f (0) = f (1).
IsthereanythingfurtheronecandototwoQbitsinthestate(F.1)to learn whether or not f (0) = f (1) (without any further application of U f )? The answer is yes, there is. But it works only half the time. Here is one such procedure.
For each of the four possibilities for the unknown function f , the corresponding forms for the state (F.1) are

We know that |ψ⟩ has one of these four forms, and wish to distinguish between two cases:
Case 1: |ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩00 or |ψ⟩11; Case 2: |ψ⟩ = |ψ⟩01 or |ψ⟩10.
By applying Hadamards to both Qbits we change the four possible states to
H⊗H |ψ⟩00 = √1 2
H⊗H |ψ⟩11 = √1 2
H⊗H |ψ⟩01 = √1 2
H⊗H |ψ⟩10 = √1 2
|0⟩|0⟩+|0⟩|1⟩ , |0⟩|0⟩−|0⟩|1⟩ , |0⟩|0⟩+|1⟩|1⟩ , |0⟩|0⟩−|1⟩|1⟩ .
(F.6) (F.7) (F.8) (F.9)
183
184 APPENDIX F
 Now measure both Qbits. If we have one of the Case-1 states, (F.6) or (F.7), we get 00 half the time and 01 half the time; and if we have one of the Case-2 states, (F.8) or (F.9), we get 00 half the time and 11 half the time. So regardless of what the state is, half the time we get 00 and learn nothing whatever, and half the time we get 01 or 11 and learn which case we are dealing with.
This way of dealing with Deutsch’s problem – with a 50% chance of success – was noticed before the discovery of the 100%-effective method described in Chapter 2. One might wonder whether some more clever choice of operations on the state (F.1) could enable one always to make the discrimination. It is easy to show that this is impossible.
We wish to apply some general 2-Qbit unitary transformation U to |ψ⟩ with the result that every possible outcome of a subsequent mea- surement must rule out one or the other of the two cases. For this to be so it must be that those computational-basis states that appear in the expansions of the states U|ψ⟩00 and U|ψ⟩11 cannot appear in the computational-basis expansions of the states U|ψ⟩01 and U|ψ⟩10, and vice versa, for otherwise there would be a nonzero probability of a mea- surement outcome that did not enable us to discriminate between the two cases. Consequently U|ψ⟩00 and U|ψ⟩11 must each be orthogonal to each of U|ψ⟩01 and U|ψ⟩10. But this is impossible, because uni- tary transformations preserve inner products, while (F.2)–(F.5) show that the inner product of any Case-1 state |ψ⟩ij with any Case-2 state is 12 .
One can, in fact, show under very general circumstances that, start- ing with two Qbits in the state (F.1), one cannot do better than ap- plying Hadamards to both before measuring: there must be at least a 50% chance that the measurement outcomes will not enable one to discriminate between Case 1 and Case 2. The proof that 50% is the best one can do provides an instructive illustration of many features of the quantum-mechanical formalism.
Suppose that we bring in n additional (ancillary) Qbits to help us out. These might be used to process the input and output registers further through some elaborate quantum subroutine, producing an arbitrary unitary transformation W that acts on all n + 2 Qbits before a final measurement of the n + 2 Qbits is made. (This, of course, reduces to the simpler case of no ancillary Qbits, if W acts as the identity except on the original two Qbits, hereafter called the pair.)
Let the ancillary Qbits start off in some state |χ⟩n, which we can take to be |0⟩n. (Any other n-Qbit state is related to |0⟩n by a unitary transformation in the ancillary subspace, which can be absorbed into W.) Let the pair be in one of the four states |ψ⟩ given in (F.2)–(F.5). After W acts the probability of a measurement giving x (0 ≤ x ≤ 3) for the pair and y (0 ≤ y < 2n) for the ancillary Qbits is
p |ψ⟩(x, y) = |⟨x, y|W|ψ, 0⟩|2, (F.10)

′
x,y
where the prime indicates that the sum is restricted to those measure- ment outcomes x, y that satisfy (F.13).
Now it is easy to verify that every one of the four possible forms (F.2)–(F.5) for |ψ⟩ is of the form
|ψ⟩=√1 |α⟩+|β⟩, (F.15) 2
where |α⟩ is given in (F.12) and |β⟩ is orthogonal to |α⟩. Since |ψ⟩ has the form (F.15), we have from (F.14) and (F.10) that
pmin =
p|ψ⟩(x,y), (F.14)
′
x,y
Although the sum in (F.16) is restricted to those x, y satisfying (F.13), we can extend it in each of the first two terms to all x, y since this adds either zero probabilities (first term) or (because of (F.11)) zero amplitudes (second term). The first term then gives
p|α⟩(x, y) = 1, (F.17) all x,y
pmin = 12
p |α⟩(x, y) + 2 Re[⟨β, 0|W†|x, y⟩⟨x, y|W|α, 0⟩]
+ p|β⟩(x,y) . (F.16)
APPENDIX F 185
 where it is convenient to write a (2 + n)-Qbit state of the form |ψ⟩2 ⊗ |χ⟩n as|ψ,χ⟩.
Note next that for arbitrary pair states |φ⟩
p|φ⟩(x, y) = 0 if and only if ⟨x, y|W|φ,0⟩ = 0, (F.11)
so if p |φ⟩(x, y) vanishes for several different states |φ⟩, linearity re- quires it also to vanish for any state in the subspace they span. There- fore any measurement outcome that enables us to discriminate between Case 1 and Case 2 must have zero probability either for both of the states (F.2) and (F.3) and therefore for any state in the subspace they span, or for any state in the subspace spanned by the states (F.4) and (F.5). Now (F.2)–(F.5) reveal that the state
|α⟩ = 1 |00⟩ + |01⟩ + |10⟩ + |11⟩ (F.12) 2
belongs to both of these subspaces. So if there are any measurement outcomes x, y with
p |α⟩(x, y) ̸= 0, (F.13)
then such outcomes are uninformative. Therefore the probability of a measurement outcome that fails to discriminate between Case 1 and Case 2 is at least

Appendix F explores an alternative approach to solving Deutsch's problem, which contrasts with the efficient solution presented in Chapter 2. Deutsch's problem is foundational in quantum computing, demonstrating the power of quantum algorithms to achieve tasks that are impossible or less efficient in classical computing. Here’s a detailed overview and explanation:

### The Standard Approach to Deutsch’s Problem
The standard method to investigate Deutsch’s problem involves preparing two qubits in a state $|0⟩|0⟩$, applying a Hadamard transform to the input qubit, and then applying a unitary operation $U_f$ associated with the function $f$. This process produces a superposition state that encodes the function's values at 0 and 1 but does not directly answer whether $f(0) = f(1)$.

### A 50% Effective Method
The appendix presents a 50% effective method for distinguishing between constant and balanced functions $f$ without additional applications of $U_f$. This method involves applying Hadamard gates to both qubits after they are in the superposition state created by $U_f$, resulting in one of four possible states depending on $f$'s nature. By measuring both qubits after applying the Hadamard gates, one can determine with 50% probability whether $f$ is constant or balanced based on the measurement outcomes.

### Impossibility of a Perfect Solution
The appendix further demonstrates that it is impossible to devise a strategy using only two qubits that can distinguish between constant and balanced functions with 100% accuracy without additional applications of $U_f$. This conclusion follows from the properties of unitary transformations and the orthogonality of quantum states, underscoring the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum measurements.

### Utilizing Ancillary Qubits
The text explores whether introducing ancillary qubits could improve the success rate beyond 50%. By considering an arbitrary unitary transformation acting on the original and ancillary qubits, the appendix shows that even with additional qubits, the best probability of successfully distinguishing between constant and balanced functions without further applications of $U_f$ remains at 50%. This result highlights the limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on information extraction from quantum states.

### Overview
Appendix F provides valuable insights into the nuances of quantum measurements and the constraints of quantum algorithms. By examining alternative approaches to Deutsch’s problem, it illustrates the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of quantum systems and the strategic use of quantum gates and measurements. The discussion reinforces the idea that while quantum computing offers remarkable capabilities beyond classical computing, it also operates under strict probabilistic rules that define what is and isn’t possible within the quantum realm.

Appendix G
The probability of success in Simon’s problem
Section 2.5 gives a rough argument that the number of runs necessary to determine the n-bit number a in Simon’s problem is of order n. Further analysis is needed to get a more accurate estimate of how many runs give a high probability of learning a.
IfweinvokeUf mtimes,welearnmindependentlyselectedrandom numbers y, whose bits yi satisfy
n−1 i=0
If we have n − 1 relations (G.1) for n − 1 linearly independent sets of yi , then this gives us enough equations to determine a unique nonzero a. “Linearly independent” in this context means linear independence over the integers modulo 2; i.e. no subsets of the ys should satisfy y ⊕ y′ ⊕ y′′ ⊕ · · · = 0 (mod 2). We have to invoke the subroutine enough times to give us a high probability of coming up with n − 1 linearly independent values of y.
Regardless of the size of n, for not terribly large x the probability becomes extremely close to 1 that a set of n + x random vectors from an (n − 1)-dimensional subspace of the space of n-dimensional vectors, with components restricted to the modulo 2 integers 0 and 1, contains a linearly independent subset. This is obvious for ordinary vectors with continuous components, since the probability that a randomly selected vector in an (n − 1)-dimensional space lies in a specified subspace of lower dimensionality is zero – it is certain to have a nonzero component outside of the lower-dimensional subspace. The argument is trickier here because components are restricted to only two values: 1 or 0.
Introduce a basis in the full (n − 1)-dimensional subspace of all vec- tors y with a · y = 0, so that a random vector in the subspace can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors with coefficients that are randomly and independently 1 or 0. Arrange the resulting (n + x) random vectors of ones and zeros into a matrix of n + x rows and n − 1 columns. Since the row rank (the number of linearly inde- pendent rows) of a matrix is the same as the column rank, even when arithmetic is confined to the integers modulo 2, the probability that some subset of n − 1 of the n + x (n − 1)-dimensional row vectors is linearly independent is the same as the probability that all n − 1 of the
a·y=
yiai =0(mod2). (G.1)
187
188 APPENDIX G
 (n + x)-dimensional column vectors are linearly independent. But it is easy to find a lower bound for this last probability.
Pick a column vector at random. The probability that it is nonzero
is 1 − (1/2n+x). If so, take it as the first member of a basis in which we
expand the remaining column vectors. The probability that a second,
randomly selected column vector is independent of the first is 1 −
(1/2n+x−1), since it will be independent unless every one of its (random)
components along the remaining n + x − 1 vectors is zero. Continuing
in this way, we conclude that the probability q of all n − 1 column
vectors being linearly independent is
   
q=1−1 1−1 ···1−1. (G.2) 2n+x 2n+x−1 2x+2
(If you’re suspicious of this argument, reassure yourself by checking thatitgivestherightq whenn =3,a =111,andx =0,byexplicitly enumerating which of the 64 different sets of three ys, all satisfying a · y = 0, contain two linearly independent vectors.)
Finally, to get a convenient lower bound on the size of q , note that ifwehaveasetofnon-negativenumbersa,b,c,...whosesumisless than 1, then the product (1−a)(1−b)(1−c)... exceeds 1−(a + b + c + · · ·). (This is easily proved by induction on the number of numbers in the set.) The probability q is therefore greater than
 1− 1 − 1 −···− 1, 2x+2 2x+3 2x+n
and this, in turn, is greater than
1− 1 .
2x+1
(G.3)
(G.4)
So if we want to determine a with less than one chance in a million of failure, it is enough to run the subroutine n + 20 times.

Appendix G delves into a more detailed analysis of Simon’s problem, a fundamental problem in quantum computing that demonstrates quantum algorithms' superiority over classical ones for certain tasks. Here's a detailed overview and explanation:

### Background of Simon's Problem
Simon's problem involves finding a secret n-bit string $a$ that satisfies a specific property related to a given function $f$. The goal is to determine $a$ using the fewest possible queries to $f$, where $f$ is a black box (or oracle) function. Quantum algorithms can solve Simon's problem with significantly fewer queries than classical algorithms.

### Linear Independence and Probability
The appendix explores how many times one must invoke a quantum subroutine to obtain a high probability of identifying the secret string $a$ accurately. It focuses on generating $n-1$ linearly independent vectors $y$ that satisfy the equation $a \cdot y = 0 \mod 2$. These vectors are essential because they provide equations that can uniquely determine $a$.

Linear independence here is defined over the field of integers modulo 2, meaning that no combination of these vectors yields a zero vector modulo 2. To ensure a high probability of obtaining $n-1$ linearly independent vectors, the subroutine might need to be invoked multiple times.

### Probability Calculation
The text calculates the probability $q$ that a set of $n+x$ random vectors from an $(n-1)$-dimensional subspace contains a linearly independent subset of size $n-1$. This probability approaches 1 as the number of extra vectors $x$ increases, even when considering the binary (0 or 1) nature of vector components.

### Determining the Number of Runs
A mathematical analysis reveals that the probability $q$ of all $n-1$ column vectors being linearly independent (and thus providing enough information to solve for $a$) is given by a product formula. Simplifying this formula provides a lower bound on $q$, suggesting that running the subroutine $n + 20$ times is sufficient to determine $a$ with a very high probability of success (greater than 99.9999%).

### Implications
Appendix G highlights the efficiency of quantum algorithms for solving specific types of problems, such as Simon's problem. It showcases the power of quantum computing to leverage the properties of quantum states and superposition to extract information about $a$ efficiently. This efficiency starkly contrasts with classical approaches, where the number of necessary queries would exponentially grow with $n$, making quantum solutions significantly more powerful for large $n$.

In summary, Appendix G provides a rigorous analysis of the probability of successfully identifying the secret string $a$ in Simon's problem with a quantum algorithm, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness and the strategic number of subroutine invocations required for high-confidence results.

Detailed overview of: 

Appendix H
One way to make a cNOT gate
This more technical appendix is addressed to physicists curious about how one might, at least in principle, construct a cNOT gate, exploit- ing physically plausible interactions between two Qbits. Readers with no background in quantum physics will find some parts rather ob- scure. It is relevant only to readers curious about the possibilities for quantum-computational hardware, and plays no role in subsequent developments.
The controlled-NOT gate C10 with control Qbit 1 and target Qbit 0 can be written as
C10 = H0CZH0, (H.1) where the controlled-Z operation is given by
CZ = 1 1 + Z1 + Z0 − Z1Z0 . (H.2) 2
Because of its symmetry under interchange of the two Qbits, we may write CZ without the subscripts distinguishing control and target. To within 1-Qbit Hadamard transformations, the problem of constructing a controlled-NOT gate is the same as that of constructing a controlled- Z gate.
Since (CZ)2 = 1, CZ satisfies the identity
exp(iCZθ) = cosθ +iCZ sinθ. (H.3)
We can therefore rewrite (H.2) as

CZ =−iexp iπCZ =−iexp i π (1+Z1 +Z0 −Z1Z0) 24
= e−i(π/4) exp i π4 (Z1 + Z0 − Z1Z0) . (H.4) The point of writing CZ in this clumsy way is that the unitary
transformations one can construct physically are those of the form
U = exp(iHt), (H.5)
whereh ̄H is the Hamiltonian that describes the external fields acting on the Qbits and the interactions between Qbits. So to within an over- all constant phase factor we can realize a CZ gate by letting the two Qbits interact through a Hamiltonian proportional to Z1 + Z0 − Z1Z0 for a precisely specified interval of time. If each Qbit is a spin- 12 , then
189
190 APPENDIX H
 (since Z = σz) this Hamiltonian describes two such spins with a highly anisotropic interaction that couples only their z-components (Ising interaction) subject to a uniform magnetic field with a magnitude appro- priately proportional to the strength of their coupling. This is perhaps the simplest example of how to make a cNOT gate.
Ising interactions, however, are rather hard to arrange. A much more natural interaction between two spins is the exchange interaction
→σ (1) · →σ (0) = σ(1)σ(0) + σ(1)σ(0) + σ(1)σ(0), (H.6) xxyyzz
which is invariant under spatial rotations, as described in Appendix B. One can also build a CZ gate out of two spins interacting through (H.6), if one applies to each spin magnetic fields that are along the same
direction but have different magnitudes and signs.1
What we must show is that to within an overall constant phase factor
it is possible to express CZ in the form
CZ = exp(iHt), (H.7)
with a Hamiltonian H of the form
H= J→σ(1) ·→σ(0) +B1σ(1) +B0σ(0), (H.8)
for appropriate choices of J (known as the exchange coupling), of B1 and B0 (proportional to the magnetic fields acting on the two spins – hereafter we ignore the proportionality constant and refer to them simply as the “magnetic fields”), and of the time t during which the spins interact with each other and with the magnetic fields.
To see that the parameters in (H.8) can indeed be chosen so that H gives rise to CZ through (H.7), recall first2 that the operator 12 (1 + →σ (1) · →σ (0)) acts as the swap operator on any 2-Qbit computational- basis state:
12 1+→σ(1) ·→σ(0) |xy⟩=|yx⟩.
It follows from (H.9) that the three states (called triplet states)
|11⟩, |00⟩, √1 |01⟩ + |10⟩ 2

 Now the four states (H.10) and (H.11) are also eigenstates of CZ,
the first of the three triplet states having eigenvalue −1 and the other
three having eigenvalue 1. Consequently these eigenstates of H are
also eigenstates of CZ with respective eigenvalues −1, 1, 1, and 1. We
will therefore produce CZ (to within a constant phase factor) if we can

192 APPENDIX H
 and the second is equivalent to
e−2itJ = eitB+e−it
√
 The identities (H.15) and (H.16) require the right side of (H.17) to be ±i. For the (positive) time t for which the gate acts to be as small as possible we should choose −i , which gives
Jt = π/4. (H.18) With this value of t we can satisfy (H.15) (with the minus sign) and
(H.16) (with the plus sign) by taking 4J2 + B−2 = 4J and B+ = 2J.
So we can produce the gate CZ (to within an overall constant phase factor) by taking the magnetic fields in the Hamiltonian (H.12) and the time for which it acts to be related to the exchange coupling by

or, in terms of the fields on each spin,
√√
B1 =(1+ 3)J, B0 =(1− 3)J,
t = 1π/J. 4
Note the curious fact that although, as (H.2) makes explicit, the
gate CZ acts symmetrically on the two spins, the realization of CZ by
the unitary transformation eiHt requires the fields acting on the spins
to break that symmetry. Of course the symmetry survives in the fact
√√ that the alternative choice of fields B1 = (1 − 3)J, B0 = (1 + 3)J
works just as well.

Appendix H provides a theoretical framework for constructing a controlled-NOT (cNOT) gate, which is essential in quantum computing for operations that involve conditional logic based on the state of qubits. It is particularly aimed at physicists interested in the practical realization of quantum gates through physical interactions between qubits.

### Understanding the cNOT Gate

A cNOT gate flips the state of a target qubit (0 to 1 or vice versa) only if the control qubit is in the state 1. Mathematically, it's shown that the cNOT gate can be represented in terms of the Hadamard (H) and controlled-Z (CZ) operations, emphasizing the symmetry in quantum operations where different physical processes can result in the same computational effect.

### Controlled-Z and Its Physical Realization

The controlled-Z (CZ) operation changes the phase of the state only when both qubits are in the state 1. The appendix elaborates on how, theoretically, a CZ gate can be constructed using physical interactions described by quantum mechanics. This involves creating an interaction Hamiltonian that, when applied for a specific period, enacts the CZ transformation on the qubits.

### Ising and Exchange Interactions

The appendix discusses two types of physical interactions that could be used to realize a CZ gate: the Ising interaction, which is simpler but harder to arrange physically, and the more natural exchange interaction. The exchange interaction involves all components of the qubits' spin vectors and is invariant under spatial rotations, making it a more physically plausible method for implementing the CZ gate.

### Implementing CZ with Exchange Interaction

To implement the CZ gate using exchange interaction, the appendix suggests applying magnetic fields of specific magnitudes and directions to the qubits. It provides a detailed formula showing how the exchange coupling (J), magnetic fields (B1 and B0), and interaction time (t) should be chosen to realize the CZ operation. This detailed proposal underscores the nuanced relationship between quantum computational theory and practical physical implementation.

### Key Takeaways:

- **Practical Realization**: The appendix sheds light on one possible pathway to physically realize quantum gates, essential building blocks of quantum computing, through interactions that are plausible within the realms of quantum mechanics.
- **Symmetry and Quantum Gates**: It highlights the interesting aspect of quantum computing where different physical processes can achieve the same computational outcome, reflecting the underlying symmetry and versatility of quantum operations.
- **Challenges and Innovations**: Constructing quantum gates like the cNOT through physical interactions requires innovative approaches to manipulate quantum states precisely, showcasing the challenges and ingenuity in quantum hardware development.

In essence, Appendix H provides valuable insights into the intersection of quantum computing theory and physical implementation, offering a glimpse into how theoretical quantum gates might be realized through specific interactions in a quantum system.

A little elementary group theory
A set of positive integers less than N constitutes a group under multi- plication modulo N if the set (a) contains 1, (b) contains the modulo-N inverse of any of its members, and (c) contains the the modulo-N prod- ucts of all pairs of its members. A subset of a group meeting conditions (a)–(c) is called a subgroup. The number of members of a group is called the order of the group. An important result of the elementary theory of finite groups (Lagrange’s theorem) is that the order of any of its sub- groups is a divisor of the order of the group itself. This is established in the next three paragraphs.
If S is any subset of a group G (not necessarily a subgroup) and a is any member of G (which might or might not be in S), define a S (called a coset of S) to be the set of all members of G of the form g = as, where s is any member of S. (Throughout this appendix equality will be taken to mean equality modulo N.) Distinct members of S give rise todistinctmembersofaS,forifs ands′ areinSandas =as′,then multiplyingbothsidesbytheinverseofagivess =s′.SoanycosetaS has the same number of members as S itself.
If the subset S is a subgroup of G and s is a member of S, then every

membersasShas,sS= S.IftwocosetsaSandbSofasubgroupShave ′
acommonmemberthentherearememberssands ofSthatsatisfy as = bs′, so (as)S = (bs′)S. But (as)S = a(sS) = aS, and similarly (bs′)S = bS. Therefore aS = bS: two cosets of a subgroup are either identical or have no members in common.
If S is a subgroup and a is a member of G, then since 1 is in S, a is in the coset a S. Since every member of G is thus in some coset, and since the cosets of a subgroup are either identical or disjoint, it follows that the distinct cosets of a subgroup S partition the whole group G into disjoint subsets, each of which has the same number of members as S does. Consequently the total number of members of G must be an integral multiple of the number of members of any of its subgroupsS:theorderofanysubgroupSisadivisoroftheorderofthewhole group G.

Appendix I introduces basic concepts of group theory relevant to quantum computing, focusing on the properties of groups and subgroups under multiplication modulo N. It serves as a foundational background for understanding more complex quantum algorithms that rely on group theoretical principles.

### Key Concepts:

- **Group Definition**: A group is a set of positive integers less than N that includes 1, contains the modulo-N inverse of each of its members, and includes the modulo-N products of all pairs of its members.
- **Subgroup**: A subset of a group that meets the same conditions as the group is termed a subgroup.
- **Order of a Group**: The total number of members in a group or subgroup.
- **Lagrange’s Theorem**: A crucial theorem in group theory stating that the order of any subgroup is a divisor of the order of the entire group.

### Understanding Cosets and Group Partitioning:

- **Coset Formation**: For any subset S of a group G and any member a of G, the coset aS is defined. It contains elements formed by multiplying a by each member of S, retaining distinct elements modulo N. Each coset of S has the same number of members as S.
- **Coset Properties**: If S is a subgroup, then any coset of S either equals S or shares no common members with another coset. This property ensures that cosets of a subgroup partition the whole group into disjoint subsets of equal size.
- **Group Partitioning by Subgroups**: The entire group G can be divided into disjoint subsets (cosets of a subgroup), each the same size as the subgroup. This division implies that the group's total size is a multiple of any of its subgroup's sizes.

### Significance in Quantum Computing:

Appendix I's exposition on group theory is vital for quantum computing, particularly in algorithms that exploit group structures for problem-solving, such as Shor’s algorithm for integer factorization. Understanding how groups and subgroups function under multiplication modulo N helps in designing and analyzing quantum algorithms that involve periodicity detection or modular arithmetic operations.

### Practical Application:

In quantum algorithms, leveraging group theory principles allows for the efficient decomposition of problem spaces into manageable subspaces, facilitating parallel processing and the extraction of valuable information, such as factors of large numbers or discrete logarithms, which are foundational to cryptography.

In summary, Appendix I lays the groundwork for applying group theory in quantum computing, elucidating how groups' mathematical properties can be harnessed for algorithmic advantage.

Some simple number theory
J.1 The Euclidean algorithm
We wish to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers f and c,
with f > c. The Euclidean algorithm is the iterative procedure that
replaces f and c by f′ =c and c′ = f −[f/c]c, where [x] is the
largest integer less than or equal to x. Evidently any factors common ′′
to f and c are also common to f and c and vice versa. Furthermore, f ′ and c′ decrease with each iteration and each iteration keeps f ′ > c′,
until the procedure reaches c′ = 0. Let f0 and c0 be the values of f and c at the last stage before c′ = 0. They have the same common factors as the original f and c, and f0 is divisible by c0, since the next stage is c0′ = 0. Therefore c0 is the greatest common divisor of f andc.
J.2 Finding inverses modulo an integer
We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the inverse of an integer c modulo an integer f > c , when f and c have no common factors. In this caseiteratingtheEuclideanalgorithmeventuallyleadstoc0 =1.This stage must have arisen from a pair f1 and c1 satisfying 1 = f1 − mc1 for some integer m. But f1 and c1 are given by explicit integral linear combinations of the pair at the preceding stage, f2 and c2, which in turn are explicit integral linear combinations of f3 and c3, etc. So one can work backwards through the iterations to construct integers j and kwith1= jf +kc.Sincekcannotbeamultipleof f,wecanexpress k as l f + d with 1 ≤ d < f and with l an integer (negative, if k is negative); d is then the inverse of c modulo f .

Appendix J delves into fundamental concepts of number theory that are crucial for understanding various quantum computing algorithms, especially those involving arithmetic operations and modular mathematics, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers.

### J.1 The Euclidean Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm is an ancient, efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, $f$ and $c$, with $f > c$. The process iteratively updates $f$ and $c$ by setting $f'$ to $c$ and $c'$ to $f - [f/c]c$, where $[x]$ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to $x$. This procedure efficiently reduces the problem size in each step, ensuring that common factors of $f$ and $c$ are preserved until $c'$ becomes 0. The last non-zero $c'$ encountered in the algorithm is the GCD of $f$ and $c$.

### J.2 Finding Inverses Modulo an Integer

Using the Euclidean algorithm, one can find the inverse of an integer $c$ modulo another integer $f$, provided $f$ and $c$ are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1). This process involves iteratively applying the Euclidean algorithm until reaching a stage where $c_0 = 1$. By backtracking through the iterations, one can express 1 as an integral linear combination of $f$ and $c$, $1 = jf + kc$, from which the modular inverse of $c$ can be derived. This method is fundamental in algorithms requiring modular inversion, such as those involved in cryptographic applications.

### J.3 The Probability of Common Factors

This section addresses the probability that two randomly chosen numbers have no common factors. It uses the principle that the likelihood of two numbers not sharing a common divisor is significantly high, especially for divisors that are prime numbers. The section concludes with the remarkable result that the probability two random numbers are coprime (sharing no prime factors) is $6/\pi^2$, or approximately 60.79%. This probabilistic insight is valuable in the analysis of algorithms that rely on the selection of coprime numbers, highlighting the non-trivial probability that a randomly chosen pair of numbers will be suitable for certain cryptographic or algorithmic processes.

### Contextual Significance in Quantum Computing

Understanding the Euclidean algorithm and modular arithmetic operations is essential for implementing quantum algorithms that solve problems involving factorization, discrete logarithms, and other number-theoretic challenges. These concepts form the mathematical backbone of algorithms that exploit quantum parallelism to achieve significant speedups over classical approaches. For instance, Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers, pivotal in quantum computing, relies heavily on number theory principles explained in this appendix.

Appendix K
Period finding and continued fractions
We illustrate here the mathematics of the final (post-quantum- computational) stage of Shor’s period-finding procedure. The final measurement produces (with high probability) an integer y that is within 12 of an integral multiple of 2n/r, where n is the number of Qbits in the input register, satisfying 2n > N2 > r 2. Deducing the period r of the function f from such an integer y makes use of the theorem that if x is an estimate for the fraction j/r that differs from it by less than 1/2r2, then j/r will appear as one of the partial sums in the continued-fraction expansion of x.1 In the case of Shor’s period- finding algorithm x = y/2n . If j and r happen to have no factors in common, r is given by the denominator of the partial sum with the largest denominator less than N. Otherwise the continued-fraction ex- pansion of x gives r0: r divided by whatever factor it has in common with the random integer j. If several small multiples of r0 fail to be a period of f , one repeats the whole procedure, getting a different sub- multiple r1 of r . There is a good chance that r will be the least common multiple of r0 and r1, or a not terribly large multiple of it. If not, one repeats the whole procedure a few more times until one succeeds in finding a period of f . We illustrate this with two examples.
Example 1. (Successful the first time.) Suppose we know that the periodr islessthan27 =128andthat y=11490iswithin 12 ofan integral multiple of 214/r . What is r ?
Example 2. (Two attempts required.) Suppose we know that the in- teger r is less than 27 and that 11 343 and 13 653 are both within 12 of integral multiples of 214/r . What is r ?
In either example the fraction j/r for some (random) integer j will necessarily be one of the partial sums (defined below) of the continued- fraction expansion of y/214, where y is one of the cited five-digit inte- gers. The partial sum with the largest denominator less than 128 is the one we are looking for. Once we have found the answer we can easily check that it is correct.

### Appendix K: Period Finding and Continued Fractions

#### Context Introduction

Shor's algorithm, renowned for its ability to factor large integers efficiently using quantum computers, hinges on the ability to find the period of a function. This process is critical for breaking cryptographic systems like RSA. Appendix K delves into the mathematics underpinning the final stage of Shor’s period-finding procedure, focusing on how to deduce the period $r$ of a function from a quantum measurement.

#### Overview

After performing quantum computations, one typically obtains an integer $y$ that is closely related to the period $r$ we seek. The challenge lies in extracting $r$ from $y$ without further quantum operations. The method involves continued fractions, a mathematical approach that expresses real numbers as the sum of their integer parts and reciprocals of integers.

1. **The Problem**: Given a number $y$ that is within $1/2$ of an integral multiple of $2^n/r$, find the period $r$ of the function $f$, where $n$ is the number of qubits in the input register, and $2^n > N^2 > r^2$.

2. **Continued Fraction Expansion**: The continued fraction expansion is employed to approximate $y/2^n$ as closely as possible with fractions $j/r$, where $j$ and $r$ are integers. The expansion reveals $j/r$ through its partial sums.

3. **Finding $r$**: The denominator of the largest partial sum of the continued fraction of $y/2^n$, which is less than $N$, typically gives $r$. This method efficiently narrows down $r$, especially when $j$ and $r$ share no common factors.

4. **Examples and Analysis**: The appendix illustrates this process with examples, showing how to apply the continued fraction method to specific numbers $y$ obtained from quantum computations, elucidating the steps to deduce $r$.

5. **Significance**: The approach outlined is pivotal for implementing Shor’s algorithm effectively, demonstrating the interplay between quantum computing and classical mathematics in solving problems that are infeasible for classical computers alone.

#### Conclusion

Appendix K encapsulates the mathematical elegance behind period finding in quantum computing, highlighting the synergy between quantum procedures and classical number theory. It provides a clear methodology for extracting useful information from the outcomes of quantum algorithms, exemplifying the potential of quantum computing to tackle challenges beyond the reach of classical methods.

Appendix L
Better estimates of success in period finding
In Section 3.7 it is shown that with a probability of at least 0.4, a single application of Shor’s period-finding procedure produces an integer y that is within 12 of an integral multiple of 2n /r , where r is the period sought. Since 2n > N2 > r2, y/2n is within 1/(2r2) of j/r for some integer j, and therefore, by the theorem cited in Appendix K, j/r and hence a divisor of r (r divided by any factors it may have in common with j ) can be found from the continued-fraction expansion of y/2n .
What is crucial for learning a divisor of r is that the estimate for j/r emerging from Shor’s procedure be within 1/2r2 of a multiple of 1/r.Nowwhen Nistheproductoftwooddprimes p andq,asitisin the case of RSA encryption, then the required period r is not only less than N, but also less than 12 N. This is because 12 (q − 1) is an integer,
so it follows from Fermat’s little theorem, bp−1 ≡1(modp),
that
b(p−1)(q−1)/2 ≡ 1 (mod p). For the same reason it follows from
(L.1)
(L.2)
(L.3)
(L.4)
that
bq−1 ≡1(modq) b(p−1)(q−1)/2 ≡ 1 (mod q).
But since p and q are prime, the fact that b ( p −1)(q −1)/2 − 1 is divisible by both p and q means that it must be divisible by the product p q , and therefore
So if
b(p−1)(q−1)/2 ≡ 1 (mod pq). br ≡1(modpq)
(L.5)
(L.6)
(L.7)
and r exceeded 12 N, then we would also have br−(p−1)(q−1)/2 = 0 (mod pq),

itive power of b smaller than r that was congruent to 1 modulo pq , so r could not be the period (which is the least such power).
It follows that even if y is not the closest integer to an integral multiple of 2n /r , if it is within 2 of such an integral multiple, then
|y/2n − j/r | < 2/N2 < 1/2r 2. (L.8)
So for each j/r the algorithm will succeed in providing a divisor of r not only if the measured y is the closest integer to 2n j/r, but also if it is the second, third, or fourth closest. Gerjuoy has estimated that this increases the probability of a successful run to about 0.9.1
Bourdon and Williams have refined this to 0.95 for large N and r .2 They also show that if one modifies the hardware, adding a few more Qbits to the input register so that n > 2n 0 + q , then for rather small q the probability of finding a divisor of r from the output of a single run of the quantum computation can be made quite close to 1.

### Appendix L: Better Estimates of Success in Period Finding

#### Context Introduction

Shor's algorithm, pivotal for quantum computing's promise in solving computationally intensive problems like integer factorization, relies heavily on the accuracy of period finding. Appendix L focuses on refining the probability of successfully finding a period ($r$) or its divisor using Shor's period-finding algorithm, crucial for the algorithm's efficiency in decrypting RSA encryption by factoring large integers.

#### Overview

1. **Probability of Success**: Initially, it's shown that there's at least a 0.4 probability of a single application of the algorithm yielding a $y$ close enough to an integral multiple of $2^n/r$. However, this appendix discusses enhancements to this estimate.

2. **Enhanced Accuracy**: It's critical for the algorithm that the estimate for $j/r$ obtained is within $1/(2r^2)$ of a true multiple of $1/r$. For RSA encryption cases, where $N$ is a product of two odd primes ($p$ and $q$), the period $r$ is actually less than $N/2$, bolstering the chances of obtaining a closer estimate.

3. **Improved Estimates**: The discussion includes how, even if $y$ is not the closest integer to an integral multiple of $2^n/r$, being within two to four closest integers still ensures a high probability of success. This significantly raises the algorithm's effectiveness in providing a divisor of $r$, with estimates suggesting a success rate of about 0.9 to 0.95 for large $N$ and $r$.

4. **Hardware Modifications**: Suggesting hardware adjustments, such as adding a few more qubits to the input register to ensure $n > 2n_0 + q$, can further increase the probability of finding a divisor of $r$ from a single run close to 1, making the period-finding component of Shor's algorithm even more reliable.

#### Conclusion

Appendix L offers a deep dive into optimizing the success rate of Shor’s period-finding procedure. By addressing the mathematical and hardware considerations to enhance the algorithm's accuracy, it underscores the quantum computing field's ongoing evolution and its implications for cryptography. These refinements make Shor's algorithm not just theoretically significant but practically formidable, marking a significant step towards realizing quantum computing's full potential.

Appendix M
Factoring and period finding
We establish here the only hard part of the connection between factoring and period finding: that the probability is at least 12 that if a is a random memberofGpq forprime p andq,thentheorderr ofa inGpq satisfies both
and
r even (M.1)
ar/2 ̸≡−1(modpq). (M.2)
(In Section 3.10 it is shown that given such an a and its order r , the problem of factoring N = pq is easily solved.)
Note first that the order r of a in G p q is the least common multiple oftheordersrp andrq ofainGp andinGq.Thatrmustbesome multiple of both r p and rq is immediate, since ar ≡ 1 (mod pq ) implies
thatar ≡1(modp)andar ≡1(modq).Furthermore,anycommon ′′
multiple r′ of rp and rq satisfies ar ≡ 1 (mod pq), because if ar = ′
1+mp and ar =1+nq, then mp =nq. But since the primes p
and q have no common factors this requires m = kq and n = kp, ′
andhencear =1+kpq ≡1(mod pq).Sincer istheleastinteger with ar ≡ 1 (mod pq), r must be the least common multiple of rp andrq.
Consequently condition (M.1) can fail only if rp and rq are both odd. Condition (M.2) can fail only if r p and rq are both odd multiples of the same power of 2. For if r p contains a higher power of 2 than rq , then since r is a common multiple of rp and rq , it will remain a multipleofrq ifasinglefactorof2isremovedfromit,andtherefore ar/2 ≡ 1 (mod q). But this is inconsistent with a failure of condition (M.2), which would imply that ar/2 ≡ −1 (mod q).
So a necessary condition for failure to factor N = p q is that r p and rq areeitherbothodd,orbothoddmultiplesofthesamepowerof2. The first condition is absorbed into the second if we agree that the powers of 2 include 20 = 1. Our effort to factor N can fail only if we have picked a random a for which r p and rq are both odd multiples of the same power of 2.
To calculate an upper bound for the probability of failure pf, note first that the modulo-p and modulo-q orders, rp and rq , of a are the
203
204 APPENDIX M
 same as the mod-p and mod-q orders of the numbers ap and aq in Gp and Gq , where
a≡ap (modp), a≡aq (modq). (M.3)
Furthermore,everynumberainGpq isassociatedthrough(M.3)with auniquepairfromGp andGq.Forifap =bp andaq =bq thena−b is a multiple of both p and q , and therefore, since p and q are distinct primes, a − b is a multiple of pq itself, so a ≡ b (mod pq ).
Since the ( p − 1)(q − 1) different members of G p q are thus in one- to-one correspondence with the number of distinct pairs, one from the p −1 members of Gp and one from the q −1 members of Gq, the modulo-p and modulo-q orders rp and rq of a random integer a in
Gpq willhaveexactlythesamestatisticaldistributionastheordersrp andrq ofrandomlyandindependentlyselectedintegersinGp andGq. So to show that the probability of failure is at most 12 , we must show that the probability is at most 12 that the orders rp and rq of such a randomly and independently selected pair are both odd multiples of the same power of 2.
We do this by showing that for any prime p, no more than half of the numbers in Gp can have orders rp that are odd multiples of any given power of 2. (Given this, if Pp(j) and Pq(j) are the prob- abilities that random elements of Gp and Gq have orders that are odd multiples of 2j, then the probability of failure pf is less than
Pp(j)Pq(j)≤ 1 Pq(j)= 1.) This follows from the fact j≥0 2j≥0 2
thatiftheorderp−1ofGp isanoddmultipleof2k forsomek≥0, then exactly half the elements of Gp have orders that are odd multi- ples of 2k. This in turn follows from the theorem that if p is a prime, then G p has at least one primitive element b of order p − 1, whose successive powers therefore generate the entire group. Given this the- orem – which is proved at the end of this appendix – we complete the argument by showing that the orders of the odd powers of any such primitive b are odd multiples of 2k , but the orders of the even powers are not.
Ifr0 istheorderofbj with j odd,then
1≡(bj)r0 ≡bjr0 (modp), (M.4)
so jr0 mustbeamultipleof p−1,theorderofb.Since j isoddr0 must contain at least as many powers of 2 as does p − 1. But since the order r0 of any element must divide the order p − 1 of the group, r0 cannot contain more powers of 2 than p − 1 does. So r0 is an odd multiple of 2k . On the other hand if j is even, then b j satisfies
(b j )(p−1)/2 = b p−1 j/2 ≡ 1 (mod p), (M.5)

so the order r0 of b j divides (p − 1)/2. Therefore p − 1 contains at least one more power of 2 than does r0.
This concludes the proof that the probability is at least 12 that a random choice of a in Gpq will satisfy both of the conditions (M.1) and (M.2) that lead, with the aid of an efficient period-finding routine, to an easy factorization of N = p q , as described in Section 3.10.
What remains is to prove that when p is prime, Gp contains at least one number of order p − 1. The relevant property of the mul- tiplicative group of integers {1, 2, 3, . . ., p − 1} modulo a prime is that together with 0 these integers also constitute a group under ad- dition. This provides all the structure necessary to ensure that a poly- nomial of degree d has at most d roots.1 We can exploit this fact as follows.

p. It is obviously true for degree 1. Suppose that it is true for degree m − 1 and a polynomial P(x) of degree m satisfies P(a) = 0. Then P(x) = 0 impliesP(x)−P(a)=0.SinceP(x)−P(a)hastheform j cj(xj −aj), the factor x − a can be extracted from each term, leading to the form
(x − a)Q(x), where Q(x) is a polynomial of degree m − 1. So if x ̸= a then P(x) = 0 requires Q(x) = 0, and this has at most m − 1 distinct solutions by virtue of the inductive assumption.

Yes. Now please give me the detailed overview of the following: 
Appendix M
Factoring and period finding
We establish here the only hard part of the connection between factoring and period finding: that the probability is at least 12 that if a is a random memberofGpq forprime p andq,thentheorderr ofa inGpq satisfies both
and
r even (M.1)
ar/2 ̸≡−1(modpq). (M.2)
(In Section 3.10 it is shown that given such an a and its order r , the problem of factoring N = pq is easily solved.)
Note first that the order r of a in G p q is the least common multiple oftheordersrp andrq ofainGp andinGq.Thatrmustbesome multiple of both r p and rq is immediate, since ar ≡ 1 (mod pq ) implies
thatar ≡1(modp)andar ≡1(modq).Furthermore,anycommon ′′
multiple r′ of rp and rq satisfies ar ≡ 1 (mod pq), because if ar = ′
1+mp and ar =1+nq, then mp =nq. But since the primes p
and q have no common factors this requires m = kq and n = kp, ′
andhencear =1+kpq ≡1(mod pq).Sincer istheleastinteger with ar ≡ 1 (mod pq), r must be the least common multiple of rp andrq.
Consequently condition (M.1) can fail only if rp and rq are both odd. Condition (M.2) can fail only if r p and rq are both odd multiples of the same power of 2. For if r p contains a higher power of 2 than rq , then since r is a common multiple of rp and rq , it will remain a multipleofrq ifasinglefactorof2isremovedfromit,andtherefore ar/2 ≡ 1 (mod q). But this is inconsistent with a failure of condition (M.2), which would imply that ar/2 ≡ −1 (mod q).
So a necessary condition for failure to factor N = p q is that r p and rq areeitherbothodd,orbothoddmultiplesofthesamepowerof2. The first condition is absorbed into the second if we agree that the powers of 2 include 20 = 1. Our effort to factor N can fail only if we have picked a random a for which r p and rq are both odd multiples of the same power of 2.
To calculate an upper bound for the probability of failure pf, note first that the modulo-p and modulo-q orders, rp and rq , of a are the
203
204 APPENDIX M
 same as the mod-p and mod-q orders of the numbers ap and aq in Gp and Gq , where
a≡ap (modp), a≡aq (modq). (M.3)
Furthermore,everynumberainGpq isassociatedthrough(M.3)with auniquepairfromGp andGq.Forifap =bp andaq =bq thena−b is a multiple of both p and q , and therefore, since p and q are distinct primes, a − b is a multiple of pq itself, so a ≡ b (mod pq ).
Since the ( p − 1)(q − 1) different members of G p q are thus in one- to-one correspondence with the number of distinct pairs, one from the p −1 members of Gp and one from the q −1 members of Gq, the modulo-p and modulo-q orders rp and rq of a random integer a in
Gpq willhaveexactlythesamestatisticaldistributionastheordersrp andrq ofrandomlyandindependentlyselectedintegersinGp andGq. So to show that the probability of failure is at most 12 , we must show that the probability is at most 12 that the orders rp and rq of such a randomly and independently selected pair are both odd multiples of the same power of 2.
We do this by showing that for any prime p, no more than half of the numbers in Gp can have orders rp that are odd multiples of any given power of 2. (Given this, if Pp(j) and Pq(j) are the prob- abilities that random elements of Gp and Gq have orders that are odd multiples of 2j, then the probability of failure pf is less than
Pp(j)Pq(j)≤ 1 Pq(j)= 1.) This follows from the fact j≥0 2j≥0 2
thatiftheorderp−1ofGp isanoddmultipleof2k forsomek≥0, then exactly half the elements of Gp have orders that are odd multi- ples of 2k. This in turn follows from the theorem that if p is a prime, then G p has at least one primitive element b of order p − 1, whose successive powers therefore generate the entire group. Given this the- orem – which is proved at the end of this appendix – we complete the argument by showing that the orders of the odd powers of any such primitive b are odd multiples of 2k , but the orders of the even powers are not.
Ifr0 istheorderofbj with j odd,then
1≡(bj)r0 ≡bjr0 (modp), (M.4)
so jr0 mustbeamultipleof p−1,theorderofb.Since j isoddr0 must contain at least as many powers of 2 as does p − 1. But since the order r0 of any element must divide the order p − 1 of the group, r0 cannot contain more powers of 2 than p − 1 does. So r0 is an odd multiple of 2k . On the other hand if j is even, then b j satisfies
(b j )(p−1)/2 = b p−1 j/2 ≡ 1 (mod p), (M.5)

so the order r0 of b j divides (p − 1)/2. Therefore p − 1 contains at least one more power of 2 than does r0.
This concludes the proof that the probability is at least 12 that a random choice of a in Gpq will satisfy both of the conditions (M.1) and (M.2) that lead, with the aid of an efficient period-finding routine, to an easy factorization of N = p q , as described in Section 3.10.
What remains is to prove that when p is prime, Gp contains at least one number of order p − 1. The relevant property of the mul- tiplicative group of integers {1, 2, 3, . . ., p − 1} modulo a prime is that together with 0 these integers also constitute a group under ad- dition. This provides all the structure necessary to ensure that a poly- nomial of degree d has at most d roots.1 We can exploit this fact as follows.
Writetheorders = p−1ofGp intermsofitsprimefactorsqi:

(x − a)Q(x), where Q(x) is a polynomial of degree m − 1. So if x ̸= a then P(x) = 0 requires Q(x) = 0, and this has at most m − 1 distinct solutions by virtue of the inductive assumption.

I'm unable to directly access or search within appendices or documents as you've described. However, I can provide a detailed overview based on the content you've shared.

Appendix M delves into the intricate relationship between the processes of factoring large numbers and finding periods, which are foundational to understanding quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm. This appendix specifically addresses two critical conditions necessary for the successful application of period finding to factor numbers $N = pq$, where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers. These conditions are: 

1. **Evenness of $r$**: The order $r$ of a randomly chosen element $a$ from the group $G_{pq}$, which represents the set of integers coprime to $N$ under multiplication modulo $N$, must be even. This is crucial because Shor's algorithm relies on finding a period $r$ that, when used in certain quantum computations, can reveal factors of $N$.

2. **Non-congruence of $a^{r/2}$ to $-1$ modulo $N$**: This condition ensures that the quantum algorithm does not lead to trivial solutions that do not help in factoring $N$. Essentially, it avoids cases where the period finding would not yield useful information for factoring.

The appendix further explains that the order $r$ of $a$ in $G_{pq}$ is the least common multiple (LCM) of the orders of $a$ in $G_{p}$ and $G_{q}$, denoted as $r_{p}$ and $r_{q}$ respectively. It implies that for the algorithm to fail in factoring $N$, both $r_{p}$ and $r_{q}$ must be odd multiples of the same power of 2. Through probabilistic analysis, it is shown that the chance of selecting such an $a$ randomly is at most $1/2$, meaning that the algorithm has a significant probability of success.

The appendix also provides insights into the structure of the groups $G_{p}$ and $G_{q}$, including the existence of primitive elements within these groups which have orders equal to $p-1$ and $q-1$ respectively. This discussion underlines the mathematical underpinnings that allow quantum algorithms to efficiently solve problems that are computationally infeasible for classical algorithms, such as the factoring of large integers.

Finally, it concludes with a demonstration that at least half of the time, a randomly chosen $a$ will meet the necessary conditions for successful period finding and, consequently, for the efficient factoring of $N$, reinforcing the practical viability of quantum computing in breaking classical cryptography schemes based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

Shor’s 9-Qbit error-correcting code
Shor demonstrated that quantum error correction was possible using the two orthogonal 9-Qbit codeword states
|0⟩ = 2−3/2 |000⟩ + |111⟩ |000⟩ + |111⟩ |000⟩ + |111⟩ , |1⟩ = 2−3/2 |000⟩ − |111⟩ |000⟩ − |111⟩ |000⟩ − |111⟩ .
These can be viewed as an extension of the simple 3-Qbit codewords we examined in Section 5.2, making it possible to deal with 1-Qbit phase errors, as well as bit-flip errors. An encoding circuit for the 9-Qbit code – with an obvious resemblance to Figure 5.1 for the 3-Qbit code – is shown in Figure N.1.
The form (5.18) of a general 1-Qbit corruption simplifies slightly when the state |⟩ is a superposition of the codeword states (N.1), for it follows from (N.1) that
Z |⟩=Z |⟩=Z |⟩, 012
Z3|⟩ = Z4|⟩ = Z5|⟩, Z |⟩=Z |⟩=Z |⟩.
As a result, the general form of a 1-Qbit corruption of |⟩ contains only 22 independent terms (rather than 28 = (3 × 9) + 1):

We diagnose the error syndrome with eight commuting Hermitian
operators that square to unity:
All six Z-operators trivially commute with each other as do the two X-operators, and any of the six Z-operators commutes with any of the two X-operators because in every case the number of anticommutations between a Zi and an Xj is either zero or two.
One easily confirms from (N.1) that |0⟩, |1⟩, and hence any super- position |⟩ of the two, are invariant under all eight operators in (N.4). Each one of the 22 corrupted terms in (N.3) is also an eigenstate of

(c) Finally, the nine errors Yi have the same pattern of commuta- tionswiththeZ-operatorsin(N.4)asthecorrespondingXi operators, permitting them to be distinguished from each other in the same way. They can be distinguished from the Xi operators by their failure to commute with at least one of the two X-operators in (N.4).
So, as with the other codes we have examined, the simultaneous measurement of the eight commuting operators in (N.4) projects the corrupted state onto a single one of the terms in (N.3), and the set of eigenvalues reveals which term it is. One then applies the appropri- ate inverse unitary transformation to restore the uncorrupted state. A circuit that diagnoses the 9-Qbit error syndrome is shown in Figure N.2.

Appendix N explores Shor's 9-qubit error-correcting code, an innovative solution to the problem of quantum error correction. This code uses two orthogonal 9-qubit codeword states to encode a single qubit of information, thereby allowing for the correction of both bit-flip and phase errors, which are common in quantum computing.

The 9-qubit code is an extension of simpler 3-qubit codes, expanding their capability to address phase errors in addition to bit-flip errors. The two codeword states are defined as:
- $|0\rangle = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} (|000\rangle + |111\rangle) (|000\rangle + |111\rangle) (|000\rangle + |111\rangle)$
- $|1\rangle = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{2}} (|000\rangle - |111\rangle) (|000\rangle - |111\rangle) (|000\rangle - |111\rangle)$

An encoding circuit resembling that for the 3-qubit code is used to encode a single qubit into its 9-qubit form. The general form of a 1-qubit corruption simplifies in the context of these codeword states, leading to only 22 independent terms for possible errors, significantly reducing from the potential 28.

To diagnose and correct errors, eight commuting Hermitian operators that square to unity are utilized. These operators are designed so that all six Z-operators commute with each other, as do the two X-operators. Importantly, any of the Z-operators also commutes with any of the X-operators, ensuring that the entire scheme remains consistent and allows for the identification and correction of errors.

A key feature of Shor's code is its ability to distinguish between different types of errors through the unique patterns of eigenvalues generated by these operators. This capability is crucial for identifying the specific error that has occurred and applying the appropriate inverse unitary transformation to restore the uncorrupted state.

Figures included in the appendix illustrate the encoding circuit for the 9-qubit code and a circuit to measure the "error syndrome," which identifies the type of error that has occurred based on the eigenvalues of the eight operators.

Shor's 9-qubit error-correcting code represents a significant advancement in quantum error correction, offering a robust method for protecting quantum information against both bit-flip and phase errors. This code is a critical component in the development of reliable quantum computing systems, ensuring that quantum computations can be performed accurately even in the presence of inevitable quantum errors.

Please give detailed overview of: 

Appendix O
Circuit-diagrammatic treatment of the 7-Qbit code
As a further exercise in the use of circuit diagrams, we rederive the properties of the 7-Qbit error-correcting code, using the method de- veloped in Chapter 5 to establish that the circuit in Figure 5.11 gives the 5-Qbit codewords.
We start with the observation that the seven mutually commuting operators Mi , Ni (i = 0, 1, 2) in (5.42), and Z in (5.49), each with eigenvalues ±1, have a set of 27 nondegenerate eigenvectors that form an orthonormal basis for the entire seven-dimensional codeword space. In particular the two codeword states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the unique eigen- statesofalltheMi andNi witheigenvalues1,andofZwitheigenvalues 1 and −1, respectively.
It follows from this that if a circuit produces a state |⟩ that is invariantunderalltheMi andNi then|⟩mustbeasuperpositionof the codeword states |0⟩ and |1⟩, and if |⟩ is additionally an eigenstate of Z then, to within factors eiφ of modulus 1, |⟩ must be |0⟩ or |1⟩ depending on whether the eigenvalue is 1 or −1.
Figure O.1 shows that the state |⟩ produced by the circuit in Figure 5.10 is indeed invariant under M0 = X0X4X5X6. This figure demonstrates that when M0 is brought to the left through all the gates in the circuit it acts directly as Z0 on the input state on the left, which is invariant under Z0. The caption explains why essentially the same argument applies to the other Mi : when brought all the way to the left, M1 reduces to Z1 acting on the input state, and M2 reduces to Z2. Figure O.2 similarly establishes the invariance of |⟩ under the three Ni.
Figure O.3 establishes that the effect of Z = Z0Z1Z2Z3Z4Z5Z6 act- ing on the right is the same as that of Z3Z4Z5Z6 acting on the left. But since Z6, Z5, and Z4 all act on the 1-Qbit states |0⟩ this leaves only Z3 which converts |ψ⟩ to Z|ψ⟩, which multiplies by (−1)x when |ψ⟩ = |x⟩. This shows that, as required, Z|⟩ = (−1)x|⟩ when |ψ⟩ = |x⟩.
Figure O.4 establishes that the effect of X = X0X1X2X3X4X5X6 act- ing on the right is the same as that of Z0Z1Z2X3 acting on the left. But since Z0, Z1, and Z2 all act on the 1-Qbit states |0⟩ this leaves only X3 which interchanges |1⟩ and |0⟩ when |ψ⟩ = |x⟩. This shows that

  Demonstration that the state |⟩ constructed by the circuit in Figure 5.10 is invariant under M0 = X0X4X5X6. We exploit the fact that bringing an X, acting on the control Qbit of a cNOT, from one side of the cNOT to the other introduces an additional X acting on the target Qbit (and the fact that an X acting on the target Qbit commutes with the cNOT). Bringing the X acting on Qbit 0 to the left of the three cNOT gates, represented by the controlled triple-NOT on the right, introduces X operators on all three target Qbits, which combine with the three X already acting on those Qbits to produce unit operators. So all four X gates on the right reduce to X0, as indicated in inset (a). That X0 can be moved further to the left through H0, if it is changed into Z0, as shown in inset (b). So M0 acting on the extreme right is equivalent to Z0 acting on the extreme left. Since Z0 leaves the 1-Qbit state |0⟩ invariant, |⟩ is invariant under M0. A similar argument applies to M1 = X1X3X5X6: the Xi all commute with the first controlled triple-NOT on the right, and then produce a single X1 when moved through the middle controlled triple-NOT, resulting in Z1 when moved the rest of the way to the left. Similarly,
M2 = X2X3X4X6 produces Z2 when moved all the way to the left.

  Demonstration that the state |⟩ constructed by the circuit in Figure 5.10 is invariant under N0 = Z0Z4Z5Z6. We exploit the fact that bringing a Z, acting on the target Qbit of a cNOT, from one side of the cNOT to the other introduces an additional Z acting on the control Qbit (and the fact that a Z acting on the control Qbit commutes with the cNOT). So bringing Z4, Z5, and Z6 to the left of all three cNOT gates represented by the controlled triple-NOT on the right introduces three Z operators on the control Qbit 0, which combine with the Z0 already acting to produce the unit operator, reducing the collection of four Z gates on the left to the three Z acting on Qbits 4, 5, and 6, as indicated in (a). Those Z can be moved all the way to the left, always producing a pair of Z gates on the control Qbits of the multiple cNOT gates they move through, until they act directly on the input state as Z4Z5Z6, which leaves it invariant. A similar argument shows that N1 = Z1Z3Z5Z6 acting on the extreme right is the same as Z5Z6 acting on the extreme left, and that N2 = Z2Z3Z4Z6 on the right is the same as Z4Z6 on the left.

X interchanges the corresponding states produced by the circuit. It also establishes that if |⟩ differs by a phase factor eiφ from |0⟩ when |ψ⟩ = |0⟩, then it will differ by the same phase factor from |1⟩ when |ψ⟩ = |1⟩.

Appendix O provides a circuit-diagrammatic treatment of the 7-qubit error-correcting code, a method for quantum error correction that extends the principles established for the 5-qubit codewords. This appendix uses circuit diagrams to rederive the properties of the 7-qubit code, demonstrating its ability to correct for both bit-flip and phase errors in quantum states.

The foundation of this approach lies in seven mutually commuting operators (Mi, Ni for i = 0, 1, 2, and Z), which have 27 nondegenerate eigenvectors forming an orthonormal basis for the codeword space. The codeword states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are uniquely defined by their eigenvalues in relation to these operators. 

The core idea is that a circuit producing a state |ψ⟩ invariant under all the Mi and Ni operators must be a superposition of the codeword states |0⟩ and |1⟩. Additionally, if |ψ⟩ is an eigenstate of Z, it corresponds to either |0⟩ or |1⟩ depending on the eigenvalue. 

Figures O.1 to O.4 in the appendix detail how the state |ψ⟩ produced by a specific circuit is invariant under the operations of Mi, Ni, and Z, using circuit transformations and the properties of quantum gates (notably the cNOT gate and the Hadamard gate). These figures demonstrate that any 1-qubit corruption can be identified and corrected by analyzing how the state |ψ⟩ responds to these operators.

- Figure O.1 shows the invariance of |ψ⟩ under M0, demonstrating that bringing M0 to the left through all gates in the circuit effectively reduces it to Z0 acting on the input state, which is invariant under Z0. Similar logic applies to M1 and M2, reducing them to Z1 and Z2, respectively.
  
- Figure O.2 establishes |ψ⟩'s invariance under N0, N1, and N2, utilizing the property that bringing a Z operator from one side of a cNOT to the other introduces an additional Z on the control qubit.
  
- Figure O.3 and O.4 delve into how Z and X operators, when applied to the circuit, equate to operations on the left, ultimately affecting the input state in predictable ways that correspond to the encoding of quantum error correction.

Finally, the appendix illustrates that the circuit produces states corresponding precisely to |0⟩ or |1⟩ without any nontrivial phase factor, as shown in Figure O.5. This figure demonstrates that when the input to the circuit is |0⟩, the output's inner product with |0⟩7 is 1/23/2, indicating that the state produced is exactly |1⟩ without an additional phase factor.

Overall, Appendix O provides a detailed, circuit-diagrammatic perspective on the 7-qubit code, showcasing its utility in quantum error correction through careful manipulation and analysis of quantum states within a circuit framework.

Please give detailed overview of: 

Appendix P
On bit commitment
Alice prepares n Qbits in a computational basis state |x⟩, applies a certain n-Qbit unitary transformation U to the Qbits, and then gives them to Bob. If Bob knows that all 2n values of x are equally likely, what can he learn from the Qbits about Alice’s choice of U?
The answer is that he can learn nothing whatever about U. The most general thing he can do to acquire information is to adjoin m ancillary Qbits to the n Alice gave him (m could be zero), subject them all to a quantum computation that brings about an (n + m )-Qbit unitary transformation W, and then measure all n + m Qbits. The state prior to the measurement will be

(P.5)
We see from (P.2) and (P.5) that U has dropped out of the prob- ability p(z), so the outcome of Bob’s final measurement provides no information whatever about Alice’s unitary transformation.
In the application to bit commitment in Section 6.3, Alice’s unitary transformation U is either the n-Qbit identity or the tensor product

APPENDIX P 217
 of n 1-Qbit Hadamards, H⊗n, and the random n-Qbit state |x⟩ arises from the tensor product of n 1-Qbit states, each of which is randomly |0⟩ or |1⟩.
One might wonder whether Bob could do better by measuring some subset of all the Qbits at an intermediate stage of the computation, and then applying further unitary transformations to the unmeasured Qbits conditional upon the outcome of that measurement. But this, by an inversion of the Griffiths–Niu argument in Section 3.6, would be equivalent to first applying an appropriate multi-Qbit controlled unitary gate, and only then measuring the control Qbits. That gate can be absorbed in W and the subsequent measurement of its control Qbits deferred to the end of the computation. So this possibility is covered by the case already considered.

Appendix P addresses a fundamental question in quantum information theory: what can one party (Bob) learn about the unitary transformation (U) applied by another party (Alice) to a set of qubits, given that the initial states of these qubits are equally likely to be any computational basis state. This scenario is crucial for understanding quantum bit commitment, a protocol where one party commits a value (bit) that they cannot change, to be revealed later, and the other party cannot determine the value until it is revealed.

The setup involves Alice preparing $n$ qubits in a computational basis state $|x\rangle$, applying a unitary transformation $U$ to these qubits, and then handing them over to Bob. Bob, to gather information about $U$, can add $m$ ancillary qubits, perform his own quantum computation with a unitary transformation $W$, and measure the outcome. The state before measurement is represented as $|ψ_x⟩ = W(U|x⟩ \otimes |a⟩)$, where $|a⟩$ denotes the initial state of the ancillary qubits and the sum runs over all $2^n$ possible values of $x$.

Bob's goal is to deduce information about $U$ based on the outcomes of his measurements. However, the analysis shows that the probability $p(z)$ of Bob measuring a particular outcome $z$ when he measures all $n + m$ qubits is independent of $U$. This conclusion is reached through a series of steps that demonstrate how $U$ cancels out in the calculation of $p(z)$, making it impossible for Bob to gain any knowledge about Alice’s choice of $U$.

The appendix further explores whether Bob could gain an advantage by measuring some qubits at an intermediate stage and then adjusting his strategy based on the outcomes of these measurements. It concludes that this strategy does not offer any advantage to Bob because it can be shown, through an inversion of the Griffiths–Niu argument, that any such intermediate measurement can be incorporated into the overall unitary transformation $W$ and thus does not provide any additional information about $U$.

In the context of bit commitment, Alice's unitary transformation could be either the identity operation or a tensor product of $n$ 1-qubit Hadamard gates, with the state $|x⟩$ being a random tensor product of $n$ 1-qubit states $|0⟩$ or $|1⟩$. The appendix concludes that regardless of the computational strategies employed by Bob, he cannot deduce Alice's choice of $U$ from his measurements, ensuring the security of the bit commitment scheme from the perspective of quantum information theory.

The following is the copied text from section 6.6. Please give a detailed overview. 

6.6 The GHZ puzzle
We conclude with another illustration of just how strange the behavior of Qbits can be. The situation described below is a 3-Qbit version of one first noticed by Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger (“GHZ”) in the late 1980s, which gives a very striking version of Bell’s theorem. An alternative version, discovered by Lucien Hardy in the early 1990s, is given in Appendix D.
Consider the 3-Qbit state
|⟩ = 1 |000⟩ − |110⟩ − |011⟩ − |101⟩ . (6.26) 2
Note that the form of |⟩ is explicitly invariant under any permutation of the three Qbits. Numbering the Qbits from left to right 2, 1, and 0, we have
H
      M
        M
              Since
|⟩ = C21H2X2 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ . 2
√1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ = C21C20H2X2|000⟩, 2
(6.27)
(6.28)
(6.27) and (6.28) provide an explicit construction of |⟩ from elemen- tary 1- and 2-Qbit gates acting on the standard state |0⟩ .
3
Because |⟩ in the form (6.26) and the state (1/ 2)(|000⟩ − |111⟩) appearing in (6.27) are both invariant under permutations of the Qbits 0, 1, and 2, any of the other five forms of (6.27) associated with permu-
tations of the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 are equally valid. In particular
|⟩ = C12H1X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ . 2
It follows from (6.29) that
H2H1|⟩ = H2H1C12H1X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ 2
= H2H1C12H1H2 H2X1 √1 |000⟩ − |111⟩ 2
= C21H2X1 |000⟩ − |111⟩
(6.29)
(6.30)
(since sandwiching a cNOT between Hadamards exchanges target and control Qbits). Comparing the last expression in (6.30) with the form of |⟩ in (6.27) reveals that
H2H1|⟩ = Z2X1|⟩ (6.31)
(which can, of course, be confirmed more clumsily directly from the definition (6.26) of |⟩.) Because of the invariance of |⟩ under per- mutation of the three Qbits we also have
H2H0|⟩ = Z2X0|⟩, (6.32) H1H0|⟩ = Z1X0|⟩. (6.33)
Now suppose that we have prepared three Qbits in the state |⟩ and then allowed no further interactions among them. If we measure each Qbit, it follows from the form (6.26) that because |⟩ is a superposition of computational-basis states having either none or two of the Qbits in the state |1⟩, the three outcomes are constrained to satisfy
x2 ⊕x1 ⊕x0 =0 (6.34)
(where ⊕, as usual, denotes addition modulo 2).
Suppose, on the other hand, that we apply Hadamards to Qbits
2 and 1 before measuring all three. According to (6.31) this has the effect of flipping the state of Qbit 1 in each term of the superposition (6.26) (and changing the signs of some of the terms). As a result the 3-Qbit state (6.26) is changed into a superposition of computational- basis states having either one or three of the Qbits in the state |1⟩. So if the outcomes are x2H, x1H, and x0, we must have
6.6 THE GHZ PUZZLE 155
 x2H ⊕x1H ⊕x0 =1. (6.35)
√

156 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 Similarly, if we apply Hadamards to Qbits 2 and 0 before measuring all three, then (6.32) requires that the outcomes must obey
x2H ⊕x1 ⊕x0H =1, (6.36) and if Hadamards are applied to Qbits 1 and 0 then according to (6.33)
if all three are measured we will have
x2 ⊕x1H ⊕x0H =1. (6.37)
Consider now the following question. If we are talking about a single trio of Qbits, assigned the state |⟩, must the x0 appearing in (6.34) be the same as the x0 appearing in (6.35)? A little reflection reveals that this question makes no sense. After all, (6.34) describes the outcomes of immediately measuring the three Qbits, whereas (6.35) describes the outcomes of measuring them after Hadamards have been applied to Qbits 2 and 1. Since only one of these two possibilities can actually be carried out, there is no way to compare the results of measuring Qbit 0 in the two cases. You can’t compare the x0 you found in the case you actually carried out with the x0 you might have found in the case you didn’t carry out. It’s just a stupid question.
Or is it? Suppose that Qbits 2 and 1 are measured before Qbit 0 is measured. If no Hadamards were applied before the measurements of 2 and 1, then (6.34) assures us that when 0 is finally measured the result will be
x0 = x1 ⊕ x2. (6.38)
So the outcome of measuring Qbit 0 is predetermined by the outcomes of the earlier measurements of Qbits 2 and 1. Since all interactions among the Qbits ceased after the state |⟩ had been prepared, subject- ing Qbits 2 and 1 to measurement gates can have no effect on Qbit 0. Since the outcomes of the measurements of Qbits 2 and 1 determine in advance the outcome of the subsequent measurement of Qbit 0, it would seem that Qbit 0 was already predisposed to give the result (6.38) upon being measured. Because the Qbits did not interact after their initial state was prepared, it would seem that Qbit 0 must have had that predisposition even before Qbits 2 and 1 were actually measured to reveal what the result of measuring Qbit 0 would have to be.
This is a bit disconcerting, since prior to any measurements the state of the Qbits was (6.26), in which none of them was individually predisposed to reveal any particular value. Indeed, it would seem that the 3-Qbit state (6.26) gives an incomplete description of the Qbits. The omitted predisposition of Qbit 0 seems to be an additional element of reality that a more complete description than that afforded by the quantum theory would take into account.

6.6 THE GHZ PUZZLE 157
 But if Qbit 0 did indeed have a predetermined predisposition to give x0 when measured, even before Qbits 1 and 2 were measured to reveal what x0 actually was, then the value of x0 surely would not be altered if Hadamards were applied to Qbits 1 and 2 before they were measured, since the Qbits have ceased to interact, and the predisposition to give x0 was present before the decision to apply Hadamards or not had been made. This means that the value x0 appearing in (6.34) must indeed be identical to the value of x0 appearing in (6.35). So our question is not meaningless. The answer is Yes!
Such an argument for elements of reality – predetermined values – was put forth in 1935 (in a different context) by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR). The controversy and discussion it has given rise to has steadily increased over the past seven decades. The terms “incomplete” and “element of reality” originated with EPR. Today it is Einstein’s most cited paper.
The wonderful thing about three Qbits in the state (6.26) is that they not only provide a beautiful illustration of the EPR argument, but also, when examined further, reveal that the appealing argument establishing predetermined measurement outcomes cannot be correct. To see this, note that exactly the same reasoning establishes that the values of x1 appearing in (6.34) and (6.36) must be the same, as well as the values of x2 appearing in (6.34) and (6.37). And the same line of thought establishes that the values of x0H in (6.37) and (6.36) must be the same, as well as the values of x1H in (6.37) and (6.35) and the values of x2H in (6.36) and (6.35).
If all this is true, then adding together the left sides of (6.34)–(6.37) must give 0 modulo 2, since each of x2, x1, x0, x2H, x1H, and x0H appears in exactly two of the equations. But the modulo 2 sum of the right sides is 0 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1 ⊕ 1 = 1.
So the appealing EPR argument must be wrong. There are no el- ements of reality – no predetermined measurement outcomes that a more complete theory would take into account. The answer to what is mistaken in the simple and persuasive reasoning that led Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen to the existence of elements of reality is still a mat- ter of debate more than 70 years later. How, after all, can Qbit 0 and its measurement gate “know” that if they interact only after Qbits 1 and 2 have gone through their own measurement gates (and no Hadamards were applied) then the result of the measurement of Qbit 0 must be given by (6.38)?
The best explanation anybody has come up with to this day is to insist that no explanation is needed beyond what one can infer from the laws of quantum mechanics. Those laws are correct. Quantum mechanics works. There is no controversy about that. What fail to work are attempts to provide underlying mechanisms, that go be- yond the quantum-mechanical rules, for how certain strong quantum

158 PROTOCOLS THAT USE JUST A FEW QBITS
 correlations can actually operate. One gets puzzled only if one tries to understand how the rules can work not only for the actual situation in which they are applied, but also in alternative situations that might have been chosen but were not.
By concluding with this “paradoxical” state of affairs, I am not suggesting that there is anything wrong with the quantum-theoretic descriptionofQbitsandthegatesthatactonthem.Onthecontrary,the quantum theory has to be regarded as the must accurate and successful theory in the history of physics, and there is no doubt whatever among physicists that if the formidable technological obstacles standing in the way of building a quantum computer can be overcome, then the computer will behave exactly as described in the preceding chapters.
But I cannot, in good conscience, leave you without a warning that the simple theory of Qbits developed here, though correct, is in some respects exceedingly strange. The strangeness emerges only when one seeks to go beyond the straightforward rules enunciated in Chapter 1. In particular one must not ask for an underlying mechanism that ac- counts not only for the behavior of the circuit actually applied to a particular collection of Qbits, but also for the possible behavior of other circuits that might have been applied to the very same collection of Qbits, but were not.
A good motto for the quantum physicist and for future quantum computer scientists might be “What didn’t happen didn’t happen.” On that firm note I conclude (except for the 16 appendices that follow).

Section 6.6, "The GHZ Puzzle," dives into the peculiarities of quantum mechanics through a thought experiment involving a three-qubit state, originally formulated by Daniel Greenberger, Michael Horne, and Anton Zeilinger (GHZ). This scenario provides an insightful version of Bell's theorem, illustrating quantum mechanics' counterintuitive nature.

The heart of the GHZ puzzle lies in examining a specific three-qubit quantum state:

$$ \lvert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\lvert 000 \rangle - \lvert 110 \rangle - \lvert 011 \rangle - \lvert 101 \rangle) $$

This state is symmetric, meaning its form remains unchanged under any permutation of the three qubits. The text walks through constructing this state from basic one- and two-qubit gates, starting with the standard $\lvert 000 \rangle$ state, and applying controlled-NOT and Hadamard gates to achieve $\lvert \psi \rangle$.

An important aspect of $\lvert \psi \rangle$ is its invariance under permutations of qubits and its transformation under the application of Hadamard gates to any two qubits. This leads to specific predictions about the outcomes of measuring the qubits under various conditions, described by equations (6.34) through (6.37). These outcomes appear to be pre-determined, suggesting that each qubit "knows" the state it will collapse to upon measurement based on the initial quantum state, despite the qubits no longer interacting.

This setup leads to a profound question related to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and the notion of "elements of reality." It challenges the classical intuition about predetermined values of physical properties before measurement, suggesting that such elements cannot exist in quantum mechanics as they lead to contradictions when combined with the predictions of quantum states like $\lvert \psi \rangle$.

The GHZ puzzle exemplifies how quantum mechanics defies classical logic, particularly the idea that measurement outcomes can be predetermined by the properties the system had prior to measurement. It highlights the non-locality of quantum mechanics, where the outcome of a measurement on one particle seems instantaneously to influence the state of distant particles, without implying any classical mechanism or "hidden variables" that govern this behavior.

In conclusion, this section emphasizes that while quantum mechanics provides accurate predictions for experimental outcomes, attempts to ascribe classical explanations to quantum phenomena—especially regarding unmeasured states or alternative measurement setups that were not actually performed—can lead to paradoxes. It underscores the foundational principle that quantum mechanics does not merely describe what is observed; it prescribes the limits of what can be known or predicted about a system.
