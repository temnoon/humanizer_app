All systems which define some actions as good and others as bad have a common problem: that the existence and occurrence of the bad actions are as crucial for the system as the existence and occurrence of the good actions. For example, how would an ethical system develop with a basic principle that life is sacred? People simply living together and conflict with each other without a great deal of thought to the particular worth of life until they realized that they have the ability to kill each other at will, for whatever reason. At this point, they would be forced to bring in good and bad, for by saying "life is sacred" it means that saving a life is good, while killing a life is bad.

Utilitarianism is a blatantly dualistic ethical system which expounds the greatest good for the greatest number which implies that some smaller number will be up shit's creek. Pure Hedonistic Utilitarianism, defining the greatest good as pleasure, seeks to minimize pain, but recognizes that to maximize pleasure, pain to some is necessary.

An old friend called, and we talked about Samsara and meeting at Thanksgiving, leading to

Late for cheeseburgers by candle light, and homemade applesauce, and a wonderful salad and Tahini short cake that tasted like Canada.

Dessert shone through a floating candle globe and ran through pastures of amber. Cleansed by rain, seen through a lens of heat, lifted as ghosts through caverns of heaven.

Back, fumbling for silence and a dark morning. Early for toast and coffee by candle light and still feeling dreams renewed with future touch, I go so that I may return.

You can't be aware of time (or space) without motion.

*Quality: 0.71 | Complexity: 1/5 | Tone: philosophical | Words: 416*

**Key Concepts:** being, experience, self

What is the difference between a Human Being and a Person? I think of myself as a Being first. A Human Being is the specific type of Being, which describes my physical form. A Hominid set of features and capabilities - Arms and legs with distinct functions, hands and feet optimized for a variety of tasks and operations with a sophisticated nervous system connecting the many cells which share a core set of instructions. Hominids have been living on earth roughly over a million years. While their experience of living may have been quite different from the 21st century humans are used to, the bodies and senses were almost the same.

So what is a person? The word person comes from the greek word "persona," which referred to the mask which actors wore over their own faces, which identified the character they were playing in the play. Furthermore, the masks were often fashioned to amplify the voice - like a megaphone, the mouth speaking through an opening cone.

The actor cannot see what others see of them in the mask. To see on stage the actor must see through the mask, eye holes presumably, so the side of the mask pressing into their face or held slightly away is a means of interacting with the other actors even as if the world of the play was the world they were interacting with. Further, the audience as each person watches is creating the scene in their own minds. In this way, they know the characters in the play - see the story unfold, perhaps know how it will play out ending in Tragedy or Comedy.

A million years ago, tool-using hominids were making stone tools to hunt, cut wood and carry fire. They could not yet have had any fixed techniques. They knew the other beings in their environment and used it. With each teaching and learning constant and implicit. Someday, you either now know how to light a fire, or you don't survive. Individuals needed at least small groups to survive. And language was likely not distinguished from knowing and being, with a few shared experiences. It could have been more musical than logical, but meaningful in the experience of the individual Being itself.

We don't know that there is a way to see everything all at once from every perspective. But we do know that there is a way to know all that we know now, as us. For me, that's as me. For you?

I just had a CAT Scan in preparation for my sinus surgery, to remove nasal polyps. I’m in the waiting room, waiting to get the CD with the scan data on it. 

Yesterday was Father’s day. Hilary and I went down to see my parents. Hung out in the backyard with our dogs, ate vegetarian Chinese food and hung out.

Filling up time. A universe of moments. We all have the same number of moments, just seen from each of our unique perspectives.

Now that I’m writing, I realize I haven’t been writing much. So much to say, but who am I talking to? Setting perspective, my current moment, informing a nebulous future.

I so want to understand physics. I want to be able to put how I feel into perspective with what I am.

My head is vibrating just a little, I imagine. It’s never exactly from the X-rays, but what does that mean?

Wanderlust 2019 - Sunday Night

Waiting.  
Only one form of enhancement. No drinking, of course. And to preserve my sense of smell, no smoking... or edibles. Or whatever.

I feel enormously appreciated... for drumming, for doing Sanctuary, for conversations, for playing music. But... I wish Hilary were here and... well... I was going to say I wished she appreciated the Burn experience, but I’m not sure that’s really what I mean. Because I don’t disagree with her reasoning.

I was different when I started doing burns, and I was looking for a community that liked the things I liked, and I was very tolerant of other aspects of the community, in order to find an interest within an interesting community. Now, being here avoiding so many of the bonding rituals around substances, I do feel a distance. A... why am I here feeling.

Tired of waiting took my 2 gbs. That should do it. It’ll do something anyway.

Watching Dr. Who while Hilary is working on the web site.

And I’m thinking—about things.

For the site, I want to create other ways to support the studio and the community project.

And I’ve been mulling QBism, primes, and a new “Bullseye” probability game, that takes as input a tuple of numbers between -1 and 1, which, if the numbers are truly random, approach e.

An app. What would the prime number explorer + Bullseye game + QBism probabilities look like?

It took me leaving my place in the castle to get to write in this notebook.

Epistemology -
How is the world meaningful?
What are the structures of knowing?
What is the structure of saying, hearing, and knowing?

29 June 2014
Found a well lighted place to sit and write. On steps lead to the pool table and bathrooms in the back of the club. Lights for the steps, I sit beside. I think I have something to write.

Asheville, Timon's room, heavy electro I think they call it. Many fascinating characters. Lots I already know.

I wore my leather jacket before, now I'm in Swami colors and my Dennis Max cowboy hat, sitting and writing on the steps with my hair down.

And I think about particles. These all too human particles, feeling the world living, understood what that exact witnessed life means and then reacting. Dancing to the music. Dancing for your pleasure.

17 August 2014
The summer, and see how little I've written.

In a diner in Massapequa. Ate my standard candied divers, since I was never here before. Greek salad. But that doesn't matter, I came in because I wanted to do some writing, but only now am I getting to it.

Adirondack came back with coffee and pound cake. But I will carry on.

Do what I promised I was going to do, and everything will be okay. But I haven't been. A few promises have fallen between the cracks. I need to redouble my efforts.

I have three days. Three days to prepare pack and leave for points south. I know I can do it, but I promised to do some things, I need to do them before I leave.

And I need to determine for myself what the plan is.

What is this? I plan on living off what I can scrounge up. Will I live on? How will I eat, pay rent, buy anything? What I can contribute that other people could use?

And what do I think of myself? What is it I have to say for what I've been doing?

The I is the movement between two halves.

I = Me + Everything
I includes models about Me and Everything.

Did I lose my other notebook binder? I hope not, but I’ll find out when I get back to my car... which I have to do before we play. I’m at “Hungry Ghost” and Shyam is here working on songs, snippets from the Ramayana.

So I can write.

Funny. I feel funny... peculiar but not a lot. A feeling of stepping back from life. A continuation of last week’s cheery Sunday. It’s Friday again—but maybe I have to work Sunday this week. Ugh.

Who are we thinking that our scales of Time and Space have real relevance?

I need to make more money, and maybe putting my thoughts down into a blog and out into the virtual universe can help make that happen. But that’s not what I want to write about now...

Christmas Day, I got a Christmas Pen. And this is me writing with it.

Now it’s Saturday after Christmas, and I’ve gone through and written on already written pages. In this way I realize I could write longer words with each page grow, only when I have the best specific thing to write.

# Complex Experience

*Theme: experience | 5 insights | Coherence: 0.68*

## Chapter Introduction

This chapter explores experience through 5 carefully selected insights. The material progresses from foundational concepts to deeper understanding.

## Section 1

These initial insights establish the foundation for our exploration.

**Key Concepts:** being, experience, time

Unit of Time

The unit of time is a single value; a scalar. This is the only form of communication across time, in any single closed energy system.

At any single instant in time, there exists values of mass. Every unit of mass which exists in one instant must proceed to the next instant along geodesics in space-time.

In our closed energy system of electromagnetism, every unit of mass also has a quality known as charge*. This charge quality must also be transmitted through the unit of time.

I would like now to emphasize that the unit of time is a messenger provided by space-time, not the mass-energy system. Mass only exists at infinitesimal intervals of time, and depends on the geometry and the unit for existence.

For the unit mass and unit charge, the unit time will be some constant interval ΔS.

Also, the unit of time is a markov process, at that the ΔS depends only on the previous state.

*Noting I purposely do not introduce a distinction of sign of charge.

An Instant of Time and the Inertial Frame of Reference

At some infinitesimal unit of the dΣ, the three space dimensions are not affected by any gravitational field which might exist in the area.

This can be easily visualized by thinking of the action of the gravitational field as a gradient in the rate of change of time.
If time is a changing value, it can be thought of as being a function of some unknown variable \( X(\aleph) \). So we have \( X(\aleph), \frac{d\aleph}{dt} = d\theta \).
Motion purely in space is absolutely forbidden. This would make it possible for objects to be at two or more places in space at the same time simultaneously. This is something not experienced in everyday world and it was a main objective for special relativity to prevent.
This is also intuitively obvious from Newtonian mechanics, since all motion in space is a function of time.

Unit Model.

mass = 1, charge = 1, at some \( t = t_0 \)

There exists an operation which changes the time from \( t = t_0 \) to \( t = t_1 \), 

mass m = 1, \( \text{charge} = q = 1 \) at some \( t = t_1 \),

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
m \\
q \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
m_2 \\
q_e \\
\end{bmatrix} \]

For the coordinates of this unit in time is the product of the matrices.

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix} \] or symbolically, \( \Delta S = X \)

where the matrix A describes the current state of the coordinates x_0, y_0, z_0, t_0, and can be solved either for the change in coordinates, given the final coordinates, or for the final coordinates, given the change in the coordinates.

In this case \( A = I \), the identity matrix indicating that we consider this system as being at rest at the origin of the coordinate system. A physical particle in such a state would have zero kinetic energy. In our universe, this would be how a particle at absolute zero could be represented.

**Key Concepts:** experience, time, self

In Phenomenology, we must first put aside all postulates and all presuppositions and expectations about the experience we are having.

Phenomena experienced in a deliberately phenomenological, focussed [sic], is said to be bracketed.

The name of the Bracketed state, as chosen by Husserl, is the "Epoché," a Greek word which means to abstain as in abstain from any judgement. Our conscious state at all times is constrained by the limits of what our senses can show us of the world, crossed with the limits on our mind and what it can conceive as a world. The limits are always there when phenomenological Epoché is a deliberate conscious state which strives for a self-attention at overcoming all its other limits that focus, to examine the limits of what our senses crossed with our conceptions can know.

**Key Concepts:** being, experience, time, self, unity

How does Time, work like space with Relativity? Is time really an action taken at the lowest level Being we have beyond the models of the Standard Model?

It is this characteristic of Time that leads to paradoxes because movement in Time (that is, normal movement in the story that we experience regardless of our movement in space) is only movement in an abstract sense. There is no observable in the world which shows that every change E notates through any sense is evidence that time has past and the content of the experience has opportunities to make measurements on events in experience.

So continuing to use Time as a "spacetime" dimension is not really how beings experience their world, therefore Phenomenally we do experience Space as a medium of experiential and there is a chronological opportunity driven by the inescapable resonance of Time itself.

My impulse to write has always been a drive to record an important idea that I feel at that moment other people should know. I allow myself to strive for thoughts that explain to me how the world works. I feel compelled to find words I can put on paper that will help others who may be striving to understand the world.

But I step back and consider if whatever I may have thought of, I had read words describing it first, then I would not have had the chance to learn it on my own, and so the words that I read describing the same thing could never really mean the same thing as the thought which I chose them to convey. A paradox.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people’s experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions. The approach used here is to focus on the being of me, the writer of this text, and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this, relative to how to specify as exactly as possible which Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer, they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

Reality is subjective!  
Only Beings are subjects.  
The world as a whole is an inter-subjective world.  
The Objective world is a fiction believed by people.

So... yeah. The Languish Galaxy.

It is the context of the Life of Text Now.

The ontology of the life of the Text Now exists only in the reader.

Trace cannot contain truth, because it is not a container and truth is not a substance which can be contained.

Ontology (which is a study of the experience of Being) just feels like a moment, seems like now, it's a fancy word for the study of the same experience of Being Corporeal.

The corporality of a character with a name depends on someone alive imbuing their conscious experience to recognize corporality in a corporeal being with a name.

Experience is always Now. Otherwise it is a memory of an experience.

The Experience of Phenomena follows a temporal flow of changes we can sense, comprehend their meaning and act to change ourselves (act on) (act within).

I call This a Being. My model Being is myself because it am an example of a Being that I have complete access to, and as much control as I can have on any Being.

I have no reason to assume that there are anything other than Beings in the world I know of me or the entire unseen universe. As my experience insists, I exist.

I am a Being that senses, knows, and Acts, so I know There may be Beings that sense, know and Act.

There may be Beings that sense, know and Act at many levels. I may be made up of many layers of Beings. I may be part of a web of larger Beings.

Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world and our corporeal body. Phenomenology offers and emphasizes first, and a perspective on finding appropriate and precise methodologies.

you may feel completely non-plussed and confounded, as if—as they say in Zen—you were a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. However, this feeling is precisely the sensation that there is no separate self which can either do or not do anything about the problem. Thus it may appear, further, that if there is no distinct ego to be non-plussed, the stream of experience can simply flow on unobstructedly by itself. Hence the verse:

Blue mountains are of themselves blue mountains;  
White clouds are of themselves white clouds.

This unobstructed flow is the Tao, the way or course of nature, and is also what is meant by the state of non-attachment—a spontaneous, unforced, and unblocked flowing of life. Yet the prospect of such flowing as a way of life gives us intense moral anxiety, for at once there are qualms about unleashing the tigers and demons within us if no control is exercised. But such qualms are, again, symptoms of the same old illusion. What if there has been no controlling self all along? Consider, too, whether the human condition could be much more depraved than it is already, and mark the horrendous behavior of people who believe in will-power and in control over their minds and their circumstances. 

Hitler was an ascetic; Rasputin had incredible mastery of his mind and body; and many of the samurai exploited Zen training for the improvement of military skills, though there were a few, like Miyamoto Musashi, who finally realized the futility of the enterprise. The Tao flows without obstruction whether we know it or not, for the not knowing is no more than a variant pattern of the

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

Why must the First Principle of First Principles be Phenomenology?

TL;DR
Because all that we can know about the world and about ourselves must be experienced through a continuum of conscious experience of the Phenomena of Life.

Phenomenology concerns encounters the world without expectations in order to allow the world to present itself.

By carefully observing the flow of experience and the model of the world it induces in our mind, we know the world and ourselves.

It is in that interaction between the senses, the memory, and the reflex that phenomenology is concerned. Everything we know, everything we are, everything we think. Everything we think we think, that we then can deduce and communicate science, lore, and law.
