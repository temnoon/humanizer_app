Discourse and Agency in the Field of Being,  
when Being is a story told in a language,  
we think we know a world bigger than us,  
including us,  
and we think we are obligated to use our corporeal agency to support a person with our name.  

---

An agent is a Being in a field of Being.  

The agent has some moment in which it must accomplish a sense of its corporeal world, and an intention as a response or agent's action back to the world, with future intention matching the sense of the change in the world, this moment.

Scientific models are ideas. Narrative passages can be serialized with which read can be understood by a person who hadn't previous known of the model. However, there is a degree to which the reader's model in their own mind is different than the intention of the writer to communicate.

Regardless, scientific models exist only in the mind of one person at a time.

All such thoughts, thoughts which manifest understanding of how the world works exist only in one Being at a time. Further, I have no intuition that other signs of reactive beings, even fundamentally simple ones, exist any differently or for any different reason.

Actions throughout all possible viewpoints are always the interaction of a Being interacting with a Universe.

Hilary’s Tips for Taking Great Measurements

Where to measure:
➢ You want to measure the largest and smallest areas of the figure.
➢ Think about where natural seam lines would be.
   For instance: the side seam, shoulder seam, collar, hem, cuff etc.

How to Measure:
➢ Hold the tape measure snug to the body, but don’t pull tight.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is straight and even around the figure, not drooping or angled.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is not twisted, or you are reading from the wrong end.
➢ Be consistent.

Working with your client:
➢ Stay relaxed and you will help put your client at ease. Adopt a matter-of-fact manner, like a doctor checking your pulse.
➢ The numbers are just numbers. No judgement, no comment.
➢ Take your time. Move along efficiently but don’t rush. You will only make mistakes if you try to hurry the process.
➢ Ask the client to stand straight and even. They should be relaxed, but not slouching, or shifting their weight. They may need to step apart slightly to take the inseam measurements.
➢ Your client should look straight ahead, not down at you and what you are doing.
➢ Don’t be afraid to gently, but firmly, move their limbs where you need them – raise arm, bend arm etc – or use your hands to find the right spot.
➢ Keep conversation to a minimum. Stay focused. Answer any questions as they come up. Don’t try to talk & measure at the same time!

Planning for the garment and fabric type:
➢ Always take the “natural” measurements first.
➢ “Special” measurements, like tight measurements, or oversize measurements should be taken separately.
   ○ Over-sizing: If the client is to wear a “fat suit”, padded bra etc., create the extra padding on top of the natural measurements, then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the extra padding.
   ○ Under-sizing: If the client is to wear a corset or girdle, build the corset/girdle smaller than the natural measurements. (approx -1” to -3” stretch, or up to -6” with adjustable lacing) Then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the minimizing undergarments.
➢ Ease: Tailored garments are designed with very little “ease” – perhaps only ½” to 1” inch over the circumference. Casual garments have generous ease – usually 2” or more.
➢ Stretch garments have “negative ease” – which means they are cut smaller than the actual body size, this can be -2” or more.
➢ Stiff fabrics with little or no stretch need extra ease to allow for movement. Stretch fabrics need less.

## Section 2

**Key Concepts:** time

[Representation of a Person]
- A person is considered a particle and thus should have an idealized description in spacetime.
- A person is represented as a sphere and is considered to be at rest in space, assuming General Relativity treats them as in an infinitesimal region of space-time.
- At each instant of time, a person exists at one place in space and can only sense or think of one thing at a time.

[Considerations on a Thermodynamic Representation in Spacetime]
- There is a thermodynamic equilibrium in space with equal numbers of heat sources and heat sinks.
- The universe consists of all matter and energy in a point of space-time with a finite amount of mass.
- As time passes, this point expands into a sphere, with the assumption that all constituent masses were electrically charged equally.
- At any small differential of time throughout the universe, there is a measure of the energy or the overall temperature.
- The diameter of the universe at any time value would have a definite value.
- Humans have limitations on how much they can sense in one unit of time.

[General Relativity's View of the Universe]
- General Relativity allows every point mass in the universe to be considered the center of the universe, with each having its own coordinate system.
- The universe at any instant in time is a sphere.
- The space-time representation of any one particle is a system of spheres called a hypercone, governed by the relation \( ds^2 = dx^2 - c^2dt^2 \).
- The present is the apex of the past cone and is pure mass with no extension in space. It's the only property that allows for change; any change in momentum must occur in the present.
- The future is described as a wave of possibilities, signifying potential outcomes and paths.

is born rides a similar wave. He(she) is a continuous function of time. At any time after birth, that baby must be somewhere, and can only be at one place.

We take something for granted in our general outlook on the universe. It doesn't affect scientific findings very much, because it doesn't change the ideal cases and fundamental truths that science pursues. However, when talking about the specific case of a single human being, it matters a great deal. To explain I return to the lightbulb analogy. Eventually, one of those photons that's riding on its isochrone hits an atom, and is absorbed. Let's say it moves along with this atom for a little while, then is reemitted, absorbed by a different atom a distance away, reemitted, and so on. Now, nothing is wrong with that photon. It's just as happy being absorbed and reemitted as it was on that isochrone, but because it spent even the smallest amount of time being absorbed and moving in time, it can never again reach that same isochrone again. It will always be at least a little behind it.

What will the other photons think? Well, their buddy was absorbed. Every photon gets absorbed sooner or later, too bad it happened so soon. They mourn for him, and look at the hole in their shell, the shadow of the atom that absorbed him, and think about the inevitable day when they too will be absorbed.

I believe that the situation is exactly analogous to death as we see it in our reality. We may have been born at different times, but we are moving on the same isochronal surface. We are all continuous functions with respect to this particular wave of events that is steadily moving into the future. What would happen if someone were to stop moving for a moment? Well, in the world he was in, he would die. His body would stop working and his friends would be really depressed. However, what is stopping him from moving again in time? What if he was hit by a truck crossing the street? You might say that if it happened that way, that's it—it must always happen that way, but why? Why must there be only one wave of reality, which only passes once? The earth is a huge mass, so it should have a tremendous number of realities waiting to push out through space-time. Remember the point of this paper is the Conservation of Time principle. Take the point about moving backwards in time in dreams literally. If the person who was hit by the truck just takes a reality behind the reality where he is hit by the truck, and looks both ways before he crosses the street, he'll be fine. He'll never know that he was killed, and he'll still be continuous in what is now his reality. The rest of the world will be there, just about as they are in the reality ahead of him, where he died, but which he can never catch up to, because they are both traveling at the speed of time.

So, in conclusion, the universe seems like a pretty nice place to me. Everyone is immortal in their own realities, all the laws of science work out to be part of one Conservation of Time principle, and if I get really bored I can watch shampoo bubbles in the shower.

Seriously, this was an overview of Conservation of Time. I've left out quite a lot of the scientific verifications, and many scientific implications, such as thermodynamics and antimatter. I have included the main philosophical points, as it stands now. I really believe all this stuff. I hope you find it at least amusing.

**Key Concepts:** being, time

Antimatter?

There are some cosmologists who lose sleep over the fact that they can't find any antimatter.

I think it's very simple. It's all right here.

Each charge could be thought of as accelerating away from like charges, without ever being affected by unlike charges in any way.
(This could be done by representing the opposite charge as a lower density of the original charge.)
This theory of electromagnetism would work out equivalent, I believe, to classical electromagnetism.
The electric field, then, would behave only as a repulsive field. Therefore the universe would expand forever were there only one charge.
However, the fact that some conservation law causes opposite fields to be always equal in number and strength, keeps objects around us, including ourselves, from expanding to infinity. We are electrically balanced.

Seen from within a single charge universe, it can see only objects of the same charge.

Boundary of Time

\( E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \) for objects moving slower than light
\( E_f = hv \) for light

For a mass m in the ground state (absolute zero), its velocity, therefore its kinetic Energy is zero.

Relativity shows that as the velocity increases the "speed" in time decreases until \( \frac{v}{c} \Delta t = 0 \).

Therefore,
Max \( \Delta t \) is at absolute zero
Min \( \Delta t \) is at the speed of light. (=0)

This forms very definite bounds for energy in our universe.

In Addition
All forms of energy which we can interact with are forms of electromagnetic energy. The speed of light is an aspect of electromagnetism.
This could mean that the rate of time is an aspect of our energy system, rather than of space-time as a whole.

Energy attracts Mass

Time has direction. Only in a gravitational field is there a preferred direction, which is the direction of time.
In an inertial frame, while there is some unique direction of mass to become from some other inertial frame.

In the gravitational field, time has a direction from mass towards energy.

The unit of time for any closed energy system can be taken as the time it takes for one unit of mass to become one unit of energy.

For electromagnetism, the electron volt is one unit of mass and one electron volt is one unit of energy.

Any event which occurs must be an integral number of time units.

For any unit of time to exist, a unit of anti-time must exist as well.
One unit of anti-time is the time it takes for one unit of energy to become one unit of mass.

In an anti-time gravitational field, the time vector points from energy to mass.

For physical significance of This,
Let's look at earth.
According to General Relativity, the higher up in earth's gravitational field, the faster time moves, and vice versa. This indicates that time is moving upwards. In the case where the gravitational field is due to acceleration, the direction of time is the direction of accelerated motion.

There being a direction for time does not necessitate there being any units of time moving from mass to energy. It only requires that if there is a motion between mass and energy, that is the direction time takes.
Space and time are the containers of mass and energy.

Mass and energy are something else. They are more specific than space and time. There's no experiment we can perform to obtain information about space and time without using mass and energy.

The mass and energy in our universe, in order for us to learn about it, must be electromagnetic in nature.
