Cycle of nerves...

    we feel something, it is "felt" and we respond.
            feeling

        consciousness
     ↖️                   ↘️
          response

    a cell either feels or responds, not both. impulses travel in nerves in only one direction.

    I miss you already and we’re barely three hours apart. Not knowing what to do, I am a ship becalmed without a rudder... yet anxious to get somewhere, to do something... to see you again and show you what I've done.

    This is terrible, I know. I shouldn’t be putting this pressure on you. These responsibilities are mine, and I must do them for me, but somehow you enrich me, and likewise enrich all that I do. Your presence in my mind enhances all I do.

    Still, this childish pining helps nothing, and only adds to my impotence to act. I love you, Tina; but for now I must put you somewhat out of my mind, as you must abandon me, to attack the problems of the day. Soon, always soon, we will be together again.

    "Do you want anything to drink?" Ned asked Sue, sitting in her apartment.
        She looked up from the class notes she was copying over and looked at him blankly.
    "Water maybe? Or how about orange juice?" Ned continued.
    "Do you want anything?" Sue asked.
    "Yeah, I'd really like some orange juice."
    "Well, I'll have some too while you're getting it," Sue said, smiling now, and turning back to her notes. But "Oh, I think we're out of juice."
        "There's a can in the freezer."
        "Oh... you don't have to make it. I just want water."

        He made the orange juice, and brought two glasses.

I've been thinking about Mom.

My Dad died last year. At 89 years old on a Friday in October, after driving together with Mom two hours to Middletown to pick up watch batteries and jewelry findings from another two hours' drive to Long Beach to deliver that handful of things to a jewelry store, they went back home where my Dad started having trouble breathing.

He had heart issues. He was in need of a replacement heart valve according to the doctors. He had to be rushed to the hospital. He had a heart attack in the Emergency room. He was revived but he never regained consciousness. He passed on Sunday night & my Mom & my Brother could sit with him for a few hours Saturday and Sunday.

My Mom & Dad had a connection like none other for 63 years. They danced a life around & about and through each other. They were two beings conjoined, entangled in each other's loving conception of each other. This is the Dance of Discourse, and the happy optimal dance they had!

We must constantly be vigilant when we use words to explain things to ourselves that the words cannot contain the essence of true information. All the tools of language are limited to evoking essence from the subjective experience of the reading.

The original untransmissible essence which inspired the use of a word cannot in itself BE a word because it is that essence which is real, is ontological. That is, what is real is exactly every experience of any Being.

"Who am I" is the ontological question. "Why am I" is another expression of this ontological question, "What am I?"

Without IT being an answer, the fact, the experience of the question is proof of a significant truth in the fact of ontology. Existence is real because I can ask this question. What my senses are presenting one may or may not really be what I think it is, but the objects my senses remind me of are all in the model of my world, in my subjective mind.

Ontology of Consciousness

An acknowledgement of the primacy of consciousness in the experience of Being, called Ontology.

To be ontic means it is a moment of experienced existence. To be existential is to experience existence in a lived moment.

To study ontology is a strange phrase to decode because the essence of ontology is that it can also be used.

The Standard Model solves the question of "how do we know what the world is made of and based on what we’ve seen, what will it do next?"

In the normal day-to-day experience of most people, all of our senses are made of and interacting with atoms, mirrors of molecules, crystals, and other structures mostly controlled by what the standard model calls electrons. 
The electrons are grouped around nuclei, while the paired quantum and controlling nuclear forces in the standard temperatures and pressures of solids, liquids, and gases encountered by people nearly every day, interact mostly with magnetic tent on an electro-magnetic level, with other electrons.

The language that physics uses to describe electrons is that of electrodynamics of wave operators in a Hilbert Space.

Beings in a Field of Being

How to model a Being in a field of Being with Hilbert spaces for physical phenomena?  
Simplest Beings - Quantum light

How to model sentient Beings?  
Sentient Hilbert space

How to model a semantic Being?  
Semantic Hilbert space


---


The Ontology of Experience is organized around Beings with 3 characteristics.

A Being experiences Consciousness as a moment of corporeal entanglement and noticed correlations between a memory, an expectation, and an action.

Corporeal entanglement happens in the fuzzy boundary of each Being.


---


A Being is an experienced perspective on a Field of Being.

Two or more distinct beings may bond in coherent resonance, such that outside a fuzzy boundary they act as a single Being.

A Being has a memory of at least its immediately previous moment, and possibly many previous moments.

A Being may have an expectation of the next moment, and prepare its understanding of its senses based on expectations linked to memories of similar (resonant) situations.

Being implies a moment of Being. To exist as One Being is to sense the presence at that moment of all that is now, and all that can ever be.

Being a moment is to create the conditions necessary for change. This necessary condition is often and commonly called "time."


---


But what we refer to as “Time” is not sufficient for the experience of change. Time, as a reference to the abstraction of a system of questions predicting the behavior of a thermodynamic system, as physics endeavors to do, is not how life as conscious beings experience the flow of life around us. 

Consciousness, not as the concept but as the actual nameless initiation of ontological existence, is the same phenomenon as time, as being witnessed from two different perspectives, the observation of the same event with distinct measurements. In the same way a particle or a wave, a moment may be referred to as an instant of time, or as a conscious experience. Time is not something consciousness has access to except through an inner initiation of one more moment of awareness through a moment of Being as Verb.

Being is Time Consciousness through which we know the world. Now, in memory, and imagination.

General Relativity holds over 4-dimensional space. Its effects can only be measured over large spacetime intervals. Newtonian mechanics is based on 3 dimensions. Electromagnetism: two dimensions. Special Relativity describes the ideal case of one dimension. The only change is in time. No change in space.

What are we?
What is all we need to know?
It has to be simple and exact.
Let's say a particle has an exact space-time position, and an exact velocity (momentum). How could either quantity be determined?
The momentum can be found by crashing the particle against a detector.
This is a change in momentum. An acceleration. This will subsequently change the space the position of the particle.
The position of the particle can be detected by shining a light beam onto it and having it reflect back, but this would change the momentum.

Introduction
Goals
A) Goals of Philosophy
1) Description of reality, including reasons for existence
2) Based on self-consistent axioms
3) Axioms should be as simple as possible.
4) Results should be as far-reaching as possible
B) Goals of Science - Since Newton
1) Satisfied with the description.
2) Also based on self-consistent axioms
3) Increasingly complex mathematics used
   a) tend to overshadow a conceptual understanding of the actual physical phenomena.
4) If a new phenomenon is observed which doesn't fit EX, start a new branch of science with new laws.
C) An ideal result
   1) If there exists one single law governing all phenomena, what would it be?
   2) This would be the most philosophically pleasing result, due to its simplicity (Occam's Razor).
   3) It should also be self-defining (recursive).
   4) It should apply to everything.
D) No compromise

Where are we? Once we develop a system of description of the 'objective universe,' it will always be only a general solution, without specifying the representation of our physical forms.
My view of the universe is that the topography of space-time as described by General Relativity is a framework in which any description of physical forms must be construed.
In infinitesimal regions, the rules of Special Relativity hold. Here, the topography of space-time has been flattened. A particle within a very small region [...]

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it. So here I am, on a plane for the first time in 13+ years with Mom, flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Coop... and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A consciousness first ontology."

Ontology is "the study of Being," Being & the action of existence. It also can refer to a being which is the subject experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own life in particular.

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of felt characteristics of existence.

The world is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in a moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness interpreted through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

I'm thinking about the questions surrounding ontology. All experience supplies evidence of Being which is to say of existence. In this way, since experience implies a conscious experience, then Ontology is only accessible through Consciousness.

But what about Being of other people... and other Beings that are not people. And what about

### From Who Am I? to Conservation of Agency Notebook

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 442 | Date: 2024-02-22*

Who Am I?

Every sentence is both an answer and an echo of that question.

Indeed, what we accept as the answer to that question is the form of ourself that we think we are, and the echo of that form is what we think the world we live in is.

Each moment, we have a unit of Agency, which must be used each conscious moment.

Only a single subject can experience Consciousness. Agency implies a conscious experience takes place, one moment of consciousness at a time. If Agency of more than one Being are tuned through some resonant signals, then multiple beings can act as one Being and all can be modelled through the Agency of layers of Being.

2

Why is it so hard for people to understand the world, when so many other natural biological creatures seem to be shaped by their DNA to know how to use their agency in the world?

I don't feel I can really understand the world, but I can see how the world works inside myself. While many scales with great accuracy through instruments we can observe many types of agency at many levels from the outside, each person has only a single subject where they can research how Being works on the inside.

3

Language, as we know it in the 21st century, is at best a hostile witness. It is a powerful tool to multiply your knowledge by the word of how people going back through history. However, the way it is used is unpredictable and most of the time difficult to come by how the styles of understanding language are all too easily manipulated en masse, which defeats the purpose of actual common usages.

This is indeed foretold in the story of the tower of Babel. But the way language as the tool designed by humans most specifically in written language has now become the motivating factor in how persons use the agendas of people as tools to do written goals.

5

Conservation of Agency

Using the Being in a Field of Being model of the world.

All that exists and are able to interact through a Field of Being are Beings.

All Beings are resonant on frequencies through a Field of Being.

A Being goes through three Phases in each conscious moment.

Interaction → Sense Field Change
Integration → Understand Change
Reaction → Make Field Change

Interaction with the Field is accessed by conscious agency through a Being's senses. Integration is when memory of the Field is interacted with changes sensed. Reaction is a resulting effect induced by the Being through their corporeal connection to the Field of Being.

I'm being bad but I can't help it. I don't know what to do! I know that person over there drinking coffee slowly, alone at that table, but I don't know his name, and I forgot to nod at him or smile or anything when he saw me see him so... what can I do now? I'm so afraid of him I want to fold up into myself like a turtle in its shell peering out with scaly eyes on a world it is separate from. He makes me cold and scared of turning around for he might still be there, waiting for my friendly return. I want to cry and run away and hold Tina tight in my arms, stroke her hair and taste her cool breath surround me in warmth.

Open... ready to receive.

"It's just understanding how things work. If you understand, you do what's right."

"It's not a conspiracy."

"I know... everyone knows that."

Connection.

When two people can think of the same idea, without knowing each other, without communication.

You know you are the other person.

You are your thoughts.

You are anywhere your thoughts are.

You are anywhere your light is.

"I feel writing"

Some things I feel proper to do, even when I'm alone.

Some things I feel proper to do, when I'm with people.

If there was no other, it would not be either proper or improper. There would be no proper at all.

We are God, on vacation.

Everybody knows everybody.

You wouldn't steal from someone you know, as long as you trust them.

Your eyes are where you see that's where your mind is focused.

It's like water. We see through the hydrogen.

[Diagram of circles, arrows, and labeled elements]

Quite a wind in time.

Mutual aide.

How do trees know which way is up?

How do people?

How do people know anything?

I really understand what they're talking about, because it fits in theory.

[Abstract diagram with lines and circles]

Power over you
Control.
Saying the words.
Doing bidding.

Who am I?
What am I supposed to do?

You which is, who you think you are in the moment, is how the world is understood by written language consciousness.

For most people, as we relate to other people, we make a model of who we think they are and update it with each subsequent conversation.

Implicitly, in the experience of each moment, we are also conscious of who I am in relation to the other person engaged in discourse. In this way conversation creates identity sentence by sentence.

   According to Husserl and Hegel (each in their own way) the starting

   I like that!! So true. Philosophy sorts out all the confusion 
in the our day to day, minute to minute interaction with the world. 
People need to understand the "philosophy" of their own experience of 
the world. That means an integration of all the different environments 
and attitudes that our civilization demands that we move through. 
Without active thought, it is too easy to become fragmented and 
disconnected from reality.

 .13> BTW, how is philosophy viewed in your universe, Tem Noon? What does 
      it mean to you?
   Hmmm...tricky question, now that I think about it. In general, 
I'd say those most in need of some philosophical contemplation are 
those least likely to take the time and energy to do it, and those 
who think about it the most are the least likely to do anything 
practical with it...but maybe that's not so different from Earth, 
is it?
   There are many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems 
around and about the galaxy, but these can be divided into two basic 
philosophical schools which are practically opposites of each other. 
Most people who understand one well can't make heads or tails of the 
other, which makes it difficult to compare the two objectively. I won't 
bother trying to do the impossible. You may surmise which side I 
fall on.
   There is the Lamish school, and the Maec school.
   Lamen is the largest inhabited planet close to the center of the 
galaxy. Known mostly for the city of the same name which occupies half 
of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

**To understand how the world I see around me works,**  
I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what I can sense and what specific details they reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see, to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history with information about how models were built and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books, even if I learned things of good use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is through observing my body, my interaction, and my conscious context at the current moment.


---


**Consciousness is a name for my mental state**  
when I am aware.  
I have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  
Consciousness connects to each person’s experience.


---


**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  
with hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.


---


**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.


---


**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.


---


**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

### From Philosophical Reflections on Loss

*Quality: 0.70 | Words: 293 | Date: 2024-02-01*

A Being is an experienced perspective on a Field of Being.

Two or more distinct beings may bond in coherent resonance such that outside a fuzzy boundary they act as a single Being.

A Being has a memory of at least its immediately previous moment, and possibly many previous moments.

A Being may have an expectation of the next moment and prepare its understanding of its senses based on expectations linked to memories of similar (resonate) situations.

Being implies a moment of Being. To exist as One Being is to sense the presence of All Being, of all that is now, and all that can ever be.

Being a moment is to create the conditions necessary for change. This necessary condition is often and commonly called "Time."

But what we refer to as "Time" is not sufficient for the experience of change. "Time" as a reference to the abstraction of a system of equations predicting the behavior of a kinematic system, as physics endeavors to do, is not how we as conscious beings experience the flow of life around us. Consciousness is not as the concept but as the actual, rawness initiation of ontological existence, is the same phenomenon as time, as being within these dynamics from different perspectives, an observation of the same event with distinct measurements. In the same way an electron can be observed as a particle or a wave, a moment may be referred to as an instant of time, or as an aware conscious experience. Time is not something consciousness has access to, except through an inner initiation of one more moment of awareness through a moment of Being as a verb.

Being is Time Consciousness through which we know the world - Now, in memory, and imagination.

The notebook is the pad I carry around waiting for the point of the pen. It doesn't care who is writing, or what is written. It's job is simply to be blank – the horizon against which the pen can cross out thin lines of blankness.

The notebook knows no time. Its pages and lines are equally available at all moments. A notebook is never finished until it is burned or buried or lost – for only then can nothing more be added.

Of course, duplication makes the notebook something else. It freezes a moment in the process that is a notebook. Suddenly, the notebook becomes a book.

So who has control over this? I could say "me," but who is this me? Is it the body which wrote the word down just now, or the "I" extended through time back to my personal birth? Let's just say that I am an individual, self-identical, extended over time, who has control over this? Don't the people who affect what I have at my command also have control, then in this sense, other people within how do I decide how to use it? What to write down about myself? What about the influence of the world – the signs which cause thoughts and actions to erupt from me? Do I really have control over those actions, or are those actions me?

What about dreams or mistakes?

What is this, anyway?

Show you, so that you may judge it, and write a better book.

It has to hold the attention of the reader to prove its point, that the reader does have ultimate control of what is being read, and thus over themselves.

I am from the perspective of any single being? I would ask you, why shouldn't I? Don't you? If you think you don't – I'd say, it's because you've been listening to what others have been telling you to believe. This doesn't mean that understanding the world and the universe is easy – rather it's hard for different reasons.

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

Can we be realistic for a change?

You must understand the world around you calibrated against your own Quiescence, your stillness. If you instead calibrate against other people's words, you will never be lead to your own stillness, and you will be ill-prepared for the ultimate calibration.

The Being never moves nor lives. What moves is time is the flickering image of the Being through the Being, with the energy moving through centers of Gravity.

Energy moves in space, material, in time.

Quiescence is a stillness. Everybody has a stillness a quiescence. It is the personal ground which defines at all times where you are. It is not that Quiescence is layers upon layers of vibrations, throbs, referents and refermals,

Upon the ground of stillness, our senses show us a world through a body. Our consciousness puts those events together into a model of the world.

There are two minds which must both be acknowledged when understanding the means of the things we see: The narrative mind and the whole mind.

The narrative mind is concerned with time, past and future, the whole and the Attention and Concentration mind is about symmetry, beauty, confession. Recognition of similarities, two sides of the same coin. To value one over the other can lead to trouble.

Beings are time travelers. In fact, they move only in time, in an absolute way. Movement in space is relative.

Light moves only in space, not in time.

Human Beings are beings. We absorb and emit light (as electromagnetic energy).

We move light through time, and light moves us through space.

So, let’s see.

If I were to put it all together, I would want to write about, as always, how the world works.

Be specific. For myself, I want to understand, between my senses and memory what will happen in the future based on what I am seeing now, and what I remember from the past. Who I am is what I know about my path from my memory horizon, and I know about now through my senses. It is my actions that move me into the future. The principle action is time itself, which is that possibility of change, which is Now.

The objectiveness of the outside world is an assumption which is not founded in observation, because all observations are necessarily subjective.

A human being is a biological being which is propelled through a timeline of sensations, actions, and reactions, all of which plays out between corporeal substance from our bodies out into every corner of our imagination.

For us to be asking questions, finding answers and writing them down, it means that we live in a world of language and we mentally spend most of our waking hours and even many movements of our minds into words, then allowing words to evoke movements in our mind which strike us with every emotion we are capable of.

While the benefits of language, and specifically the written languages which have conquered the entire species, are diverse and fundamental to our way of life, it is crucial that we step back and for a moment question what we may have lost by growing so dependent on the modes of thinking demanded by written language consciousness.

What is required for a calculus of consciousness? A model of a Being in a Subjective Field of Being.

Definitions—
Being Energy = Being as a Verb = Be

The amount of Energy embodied in the fundamental cycle of each Being.

Being Mass = Being as a Noun = Bm

The Returned Energy that is not dissipated in the fundamental cycle of each being.

The rate of time is relative to the local time field = gravity field.
The fact of time (consciousness) is an attribute of Being.

I woke a little while ago from a vivid dream about a child - a daughter of mine when she was young.

I got up, peed, and quietly (there were maybe eight other guys sleeping) in bunk beds, got clothes, my wallet, vest, and walked out to my car.

Blue channel now, that time when the sky is starting to get light where the sun will soon rise, but much of the sky is still dark. The sky shows a gradient of every color blue, deep dark blue to a pale sky blue. And every minute it changes greatly until it is down.

This is that auspicious time & magic time. A spiritual time, and here where I am in my car waiting, this is a spiritual place. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in Wappinger's Falls, NY. Something of a spiritual home for me. Not the only one, but a significant one. But isn't a Religion, what is religion, and what doesn't have to do with spirituality & what does it have to do with my spirit? Now is the question I think of as well explore, as the light of the day invades the dark of night.

When I think of "Religion," I think of something like Judaism, a faith I was brought up in. I was brought up to identify with it. Somehow my name, my face, my hair, all said "Jew" from the day I was born on the ward on my birth certificate said it, peeing between my legs said it. By the time I was a week old, I was cut to conform to being a Jew.

But though my parents were not religious at all, they got a discount on nursery school if they joined the temple - it was based on, so they did. I learned Jewish stories, Jewish traditions, Jewish words, I learned Hebrew... well not really, I learned the alphabet and how to pronounce the words and by the time I was 13 I could read enough to be Bar Mitzvahed. Insert big party.

I wasn't done with Judaism either, but I wasn't convinced either. Religions seemed to claim they had the answers, wrapped in stories about how the world came to be the way it is now. So I kept going to religious school, in the Reform temple I'd been raised in. I was interested in the questions the books said it answered so I did my due diligence. But I didn't get it.

Alongside my Jewish upbringing, I was also going to public school and learning about science. Judaism had this character they kept talking about - God. The books said some interesting things, but they all ended with "something God said," and that was the end of it, where else to go? Just say the prayers and you could get the bread. Whatever.

Science had a different approach. If I observed things, I tried things out, took notes and could be used to do things, to build better tools, to make more precise measurements, etc. Before long, I favored science over religion. I wrote an essay in High School on why I didn't believe in God.

Then I went to college. I learned science as a scientist might, at least at the beginning stages. Math, Chemistry, Physics, separate fields but there was a clear progression of order in everything I saw, everything I touched. I learned of people, polished.

One night walking around my neighborhood home for thanksgiving and wandering in a light snow feeling like I was in the bottom of a beaker with a crystal precipitating out of solution. I fell to my knees in wonder and awe. I was looking into the street light where I felt rather than understood the order to all things in the universe. Each bit of energy, the annihilation of a B, of me, that I was a part of a wave pushing out of the earth through me. I was a huge molecule, a standing wave of energetic cycles.

If we think of thinking as what we do with words in our minds, then we are limited. Words do not occur in our minds alone, they stream through our thoughts in sentences. Whether we read a sentence, hear a sentence, or think a sentence to ourselves, it requires time. Conscious time. Every day, during our waking hours, our thoughts are limited by the number of sentences our mind can recognize. More or less 10,000 sentences, max.

This limit, a type of absolute limit on the sentences any person can process in a day, has consequences. In terms of information processing, the experience of a sentence is conjoined with the meaning of that sentence to the person whose mind experiences the sentence and its meaning. The meaning of a sentence to an individual is wrapped up with the model of that person’s world and the world is a wide assortment of other people. More specifically, sentences are meaningful in the context of a person’s relationships with other people through a lifetime of discourse.

We spend our lives reading a book we call "My Life," with each moment passing through in addition to what happens we are probably going to understand today in the context of all the sentences we’ve heard, said, or seen, somewhere that adds to what I know about where I am in this book I call "My Life."

Language doesn’t necessarily force anyone to believe that the words we have heard, the stories we know, define our identity and the foundation of what is possible. But everything we do does.

But written language, specifically languages which entail beliefs in words changes which turns the Being in the motion of time itself into the experience of living one single moment. The experience of living — on its head.

Without written language, language is always resonance with another Being. The context of all spoken gestures or any action, is the moment, what both beings take away is the shared moment with another being.

Writing separates the words from the moment and anchors the meaning to something removed from the moment. The word has a meaning even without being used.

In this way, the internal narrator is born, and our thoughts are not a mix of sense impressions, memories of relevances of events which follow, and teachings and learning from others we live with.

We still sing and dance, perhaps, but the creation of a social identity built on institutions of books requires us to understand ourself and the world in sentences. In so doing, we demote the value of everything we may do which cannot be conveyed in sentences.

There is only so much time in a day. It takes about seven seconds to think a sentence. You may be saying the sentence, you may be hearing someone talk, you may be reading an article. You may be taking a shower and thinking about where you left the soap. Only so many sentences.

10,000 sentences is a practical high end of how many sentences you can notice in a day. There are plenty of activities that don’t require sentence-thinking. But even when alone, I notice narratives and even dialogues bubble out of my mind. Perhaps there’s something I want to say to a particular person, and when I form the complete sentence, it occurs to me what they may think of it.

This is a kind of budget. It’s related to the limits of time, but seeing this as a real limit on my own attention.

Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world, and our corporeal body. Phenomenology offers and emphasizes first, and a perspective on finding appropriate and precise methodologies.

absurd attempt to transform the transformer, arising from the illusory distinction of thinker and thought, experiencer and experience.

So long as this subtle confusion remains, one can be beguiled into various ways of trying to meditate, and a competent guru will suggest techniques so clever that their absurdity will be difficult to discover without resolute attempts to follow them through. Furthermore, the aspirations and minor successes of other seekers will compound a collective illusion, and even a mutual one-upmanship contest, of believing that this or that method or guru is, at last, the one that really works. Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind. As the Zen patriarch Seng-ts'an put it:

The wise person does not strive;  
The ignorant man ties himself up...  
If you work on your mind with your mind,  
How can you avoid an immense confusion?

But once it has been explained, you may naturally ask whether it is really necessary to go through all this rigorous folly to dissipate the illusion. You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through. Yet shouldn’t it be clear that the very question "Is it necessary in order to dissipate?" arises directly from the illusion itself?

But once it has been explained, you may naturally ask whether it is really necessary to go through all this rigorous folly to dissipate the illusion. You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through. Yet shouldn’t it be clear that the very question "Is it necessary in order to dissipate?" arises directly from the illusion itself? If it isn’t clear, you will have the itch to go through the discipline, and try to "get some attainment and rise to some higher rank of spiritual superiority." But if it is clear,

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

I'm getting bored with writing.

It's because I'm hardly saying anything at all.

Of course, maybe that's something, in itself.

It is impossible to determine exactly where my tax dollar (this one here with a little rip under the left one) goes. It completely loses its identity in the coffers of the government.

This is the same as what time does to matter.


---


Feel like I'm playing monopoly, paying the rent, the phone bill, and heat.


---


Universality of aesthetics

People have different likes and dislikes but there is something in aesthetics which is universal. Musical laws are true for everyone. Beauty is often culturally bound, but balance is universal.


---


An intuitive understanding of aesthetics exists in all people but for rational minds to use aesthetics, it must be exercised.

Analysis is necessary in aesthetics to fully understand actions in the world. Judgments of actions are far more meaningful when people in general and the subjects of the action in particular are known. Facts rationally correlated and understood are essential to any ethical theory. Still, an aesthetic understanding is necessary using the results of the analysis in an aesthetic judgment.


---


"Social Artists"
- Everyone should be such an artist.


---


Utilitarianism asks you to step back from the world and analyze an action by extrapolating the probable results of the action. Therefore, the Utilitarian decision is one not made in the world as it is, but a decision made in an abstracted world of the future using analysis of as many facts as are deemed appropriate. An aesthetic decision would be based as much as possible on acting in the world, and an intuitive understanding of them.

"I think there's some good stuff in this magazine. Not too much, but some."

A wonderful weekend, with a sword poised over both our heads.
I should have been stronger.

I should have made her work!
I should have made myself work.

But it all seemed such a perfect picture, as we flowed through the world with each other, at hand. And we never forgot what had to be done. It was always there, when we were ready for it.

Now, we're back to business. Let's show them we can play their game too, so we can get back to ours. It will be even prettier, next time.

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.


THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already


# 3


To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.


# 2


other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

"Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.


THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

### From Being in Field Framework

*Quality: 0.40 | Words: 173 | Date: 2024-01-27*

Most of the time we aren't thinking about who we are. We are just Being. That means as consciousness performs a chronological operation on a Field of Consciousness which includes a world, a Field of Being, and an internal "theoretical" account of a world of Being and a range of other worlds and spaces of Beings in those Fields of Being, including family, whatever experience which from a specific conscious moment is directed towards.

When we do "think" about who we are, we tend to understand the question to be in the context of "who am I in relation to the world of people that I know." So "how would I describe myself to someone else" forms a way to answer the question of who we may think we are. Ultimately, we may think of ways of describing ourselves to ourselves and may come to believe these internal narratives as true.

However, they can never actually be who we are because most of the time we just Be, not answering an abstract question.

falling away from the eternal now while engaged in other and more strenuous activities. Now the habitual use of muscular tension as the referent for the ego in looking, listening, and willing carries over into the use of natural physical exertion in running, lifting, and hauling so as to make such actions seem entirely different from those which happen "of themselves," spontaneously. Curiously, this sets up, say, in the effort to run, a redundant effort to make the effort, giving the impression that the exertion of running is a direct demonstration of the activity and potency of the ego-image. We have learned, mostly as children, to put on an act of strenuousness while doing strenuous things. Yet efforts to make efforts, being redundant, work against the natural use of muscular energy in such a way that they are self-imposed obstacles, or efforts against effort. It is as if, in pulling, the triceps were to work against the biceps. When this redundant use of effort falls away, it becomes obvious that decisions to do this or that, and the consequent physical actions, happen of themselves like everything else.

For free action is certainly not caused by a purely abstract "I." It emerges from the total intelligence of the organism, in the same way as the growth of the brain and the digestion of food, and it will employ conscious reasoning in situations where reasoning is an appropriate tool. This would perhaps be called biologically or physically "determined" action by those who separate the organism from the rest of the universe, and see it "obeying" or "responding" to "drives" which have first been defined as external to itself.

But the individual-and-universe has no external or extraneous determinant. The individual may be seen as constrained by natural processes only when viewed out of context as something in but not of its whole environment. Laws and artificial restraints become necessary when, through the illusion of separateness, the individual loses touch with his organic intelligence and feels at odds with his environment. Obviously, the operation of organic intelligence is not to be confused with the false spontaneity of actions deliberately calculated to be at variance with natural order or human law. Social conventions still govern those who go out of their way to oppose them.

In past times all matters concerning the practice of contemplation were considered esoteric or, what amounts in the West to the same thing, heretical—though not every heresy was of this order, and the contemplative way became heresy only as people tried to describe its content. For, speaking in religious language, it would be plain to the contemplative that only God exists, and that there is nothing other than God. For obvious reasons this is a doctrine greatly feared by both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. On the one hand, when it is necessary that the people be exploited and oppressed, it is important to imbue them with a servile mentality. On the other hand, when people are vulgar and greedy, the mere idea that "all is God" or that good and evil are polar is used to justify every wanton excess. It is for this reason that governments forbid the ingestion of hemp flowers and other psychedelic substances, lest immature and half-civilized individuals profane the mysteries. One does not wish noble wines to be used for drunken brawls.

The fiction of the isolated ego or person as the real individual has therefore been implanted to stimulate the feeling of creatureliness and the fear of God. It is likewise advantageous to rulers that the people be blind to the polarity of life and death, and so fear death if they fear not God. But when those who implant this fiction are also its dupes, they seek for themselves as persons the powers which they already enjoy as God, but have forgotten. In this endeavor they resort to such crude wisdom as may be expressed in linear signs, words, and numbers for the government of a non-linear and immeasurably subtle world. And as the person is a linear version of man, confused with the real man, so the linear understanding of the world—with which linear wisdom must deal—is confused with the real world. Only by violence, then, can the real and living world be straightened out, squared away, evened off, boxed into clear-cut categories, and so conformed to the crudities of linear wisdom. Consequently, all the balances and interdependencies of nature are thrown into confusion—to the bewilderment of birds, beasts, and plants, and the befuddlement of man's own non-linear body and brain. In such an emergency it is necessary to take the risks of exposing the illusion of the person and all its works, and to allow what has been esoteric to become generally known.

It is thus that, in contemplation, man discovers himself as inseparable from the cosmos as a whole in both its positive and negative aspects, its appearances and disappearances. Astronomy and physics are therefore theoretical adumbrations of the vastness of our dimensions,


# 15


for it is not simply that we are subordinate parts of the system, but that the entire system is oneself in its full and only true sense. Ordinarily, we may glimpse this truth in a shallowly intellectual way, and consider it as a lofty idea that has little relation to practical affairs and basic emotions. But in contemplation this view is as real and self-evident as breathing, and enables the problems of mundane life to be seen in their true perspective—sub specie aeternitatis—balancing and correcting the usual myopia of exclusive preoccupation with nasty little games and schemes.

Nature, that is, our own true nature, is bringing these preoccupations to a stop by coming forth with the technical power to pursue them on a colossal scale, hitherto unknown. Pursued and magnified with such power, they come swiftly to absurdity and catastrophe—so that their innate contradictions become obvious to all. For we have been trying to harness technology to the impossible game of having positive without negative, defying the principles of that very electricity upon which technology so largely depends. This objective is as illusory as the ego which seeks it.

Thus a time when the objective seems clearly unattainable is a time ripe for the unmasking of that ego—itself the persona-mask which conceals the splendor of our Original Face. When spring comes the buds break out of their husks, the little birds cast off their shells, and young plants burst from their seed-casings.... When there is a crack in the Cosmic Egg, Buddha is about to be born.

This is a Phenomenological perspective on Consciousness.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world (whether a dream or somehow "actual"), and understanding the world with a personal model built up over days, then weeks, then months, then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are in space and see how what we call consciousness is never quite the "thing" we are thinking about, but in fact it is time "itself" seeing through our eyes. What "we" often consider ourself is some person we know in the field of persons and judge those events from a new time, a new context, and if we identify with that idea of that person who we think we are, then we cannot see the clear consciousness of who we are now, in this moment.

This is a Phenomenological perspective on Consciousness.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world (whether a dream or somehow actual), and understanding the world with a personal model built up over days, then weeks, then months, then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are in space and see how what we call consciousness is never quite what we are thinking about, but in fact it is time *itself*, seeing through our eyes. What "we" often consider ourself is some person we know in the field of persons and judge those events from a new time or new context, and if we identify with that idea of that person who we think we are, then we cannot see the clear consciousness of who we are now, in this moment.

That is why we invoke the Brackets of the Phenomenological Epoché.

It's Time to start over.

Suppose you've been taught to understand the workings of people society and overall culture in terms of Belief Systems. You learn a few ideas about each, and somewhere you decide what you believe, who you think you are and you settle down to talk to people who think like you about people you think don't think like you, among other things.

I'm suggesting to put all that aside. What do you believe about belief? What do you believe anything here, or at least what will not ask you or anyone to believe what you are not saying these words to be believed, but to give you a vocabulary about consciousness and what it evokes, what it means to you... and I hope to inspire you a little to step back from thinking anything gained by believing words without understanding fully what the words mean, without having worked the details out yourself.

*Quality: 0.30 | Words: 122 | Date: 2024-01-27*

Scientific models are ideas. Narrative passages can be serialized with which read can be understood by a person who hadn't previous known of the model. However, there is a degree to which the reader's model in their own mind is different than the intention of the writer to communicate.

Regardless, scientific models exist only in the mind of one person at a time.

All such thoughts, thoughts which manifest understanding of how the world works exist only in one Being at a time. Further, I have no intuition that other signs of reactive beings, even fundamentally simple ones, exist any differently or for any different reason.

Actions throughout all possible viewpoints are always the interaction of a Being interacting with a Universe.

The Two Forces

Gravity is the force of mass.
Electromagnetism is the force of energy.

Detection of movement in time.

Pure time is constantly advancing at a constant rate for any particle in its own frame of reference. However, this change can only be detected if there is some corresponding change in space
e.g. The hand of a clock moving or the beat of a heart.

[The end of the text is faded and not fully legible.]

At any present t(0), there is a frame of reference. There is a unique particle at rest in this frame. All other particles & the universe have a relative velocity.
A model of this particle could be as follows:
1) This particle has a method of interaction with all similar particles.
2) The universe of a particle is defined as all of the particles with which it is interacting.
3) The particle is interacting with all other particles of the universe, at every present t(x) time.
4) The particle has attractive and repulsive forces.
5) Every particle in the universe is either moving towards or moving away from the number moving at the same speed will be so few as to be ignored.

A model of the universe could be something along these lines.
Given a frame of reference anywhere within the universe, half the universe appears to be heading towards you, half away.
The half that is heading towards, can't be detected except its mass.
The half heading towards us is "visible" in the electromagnetic spectrum.

[There is a hand-drawn diagram that illustrates the concept of the universe model, with lines converging at a point labeled Δt.]

Our mind is the controller of the body. Every muscle is paired with one neuron to control that muscle. To have perfect control of our minds we must attain perfect control of our bodies.

The nerves from the senses are different pathways than the nerves out to the muscles. Impulses flow only in one direction.

We see in one space, act in another.

Still, for us it "seems" the same subuniverse.

An observer with only one time source in its subuniverse can only move one "mass" forward in time.

That one mass forward in time brings all signals from all other subuniverses in. The observer is a perspective of all the universe.

The observer "sees" other subuniverses with the same mass. Through resonance, their rates in time correspond.

motion in time is carried on:
    emag -> (forward)
    (backward) <- gravity

All phenomena are music, created by the time sources.

All time sources should sing as much as they listen.

People are time sources, but there are so few musicians among us these days. We are satisfied to just watch and listen.

Search for reasons. That's what philosophy is for me.

We assume that causes lead to effects because by assuming that, we see our assumptions are verified by seeing causes leading to effects.

We further assume that what we see is in turn caused by some action in the world.

She works here.
That tells us something about her.

We are on our way to the "search for reasons" with her.

We figure we know everything about ourselves. That is the measure we will make of her. Our self is the rule.

Hilary’s Tips for Taking Great Measurements

Where to measure:
➢ You want to measure the largest and smallest areas of the figure.
➢ Think about where natural seam lines would be.
   For instance: the side seam, shoulder seam, collar, hem, cuff etc.

How to Measure:
➢ Hold the tape measure snug to the body, but don’t pull tight.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is straight and even around the figure, not drooping or angled.
➢ Make sure your tape measure is not twisted, or you are reading from the wrong end.
➢ Be consistent.

Working with your client:
➢ Stay relaxed and you will help put your client at ease. Adopt a matter-of-fact manner, like a doctor checking your pulse.
➢ The numbers are just numbers. No judgement, no comment.
➢ Take your time. Move along efficiently but don’t rush. You will only make mistakes if you try to hurry the process.
➢ Ask the client to stand straight and even. They should be relaxed, but not slouching, or shifting their weight. They may need to step apart slightly to take the inseam measurements.
➢ Your client should look straight ahead, not down at you and what you are doing.
➢ Don’t be afraid to gently, but firmly, move their limbs where you need them – raise arm, bend arm etc – or use your hands to find the right spot.
➢ Keep conversation to a minimum. Stay focused. Answer any questions as they come up. Don’t try to talk & measure at the same time!

Planning for the garment and fabric type:
➢ Always take the “natural” measurements first.
➢ “Special” measurements, like tight measurements, or oversize measurements should be taken separately.
   ○ Over-sizing: If the client is to wear a “fat suit”, padded bra etc., create the extra padding on top of the natural measurements, then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the extra padding.
   ○ Under-sizing: If the client is to wear a corset or girdle, build the corset/girdle smaller than the natural measurements. (approx -1” to -3” stretch, or up to -6” with adjustable lacing) Then take a new set of measurements with the client wearing the minimizing undergarments.
➢ Ease: Tailored garments are designed with very little “ease” – perhaps only ½” to 1” inch over the circumference. Casual garments have generous ease – usually 2” or more.
➢ Stretch garments have “negative ease” – which means they are cut smaller than the actual body size, this can be -2” or more.
➢ Stiff fabrics with little or no stretch need extra ease to allow for movement. Stretch fabrics need less.

And remember:
