Cycle of nerves...

    we feel something, it is "felt" and we respond.
            feeling

        consciousness

    a cell either feels or responds, not both. impulses travel in nerves in only one direction.

    "It's a beautiful instrument, heavy and hand made, on Tidoom."
    "It looks nice... do you have the standard information?"
    "Of course."
    "Let me see it on crystal, for Dreelge."

    I miss you already and we’re barely three hours apart. Not knowing what to do, I am a ship becalmed without a rudder... yet anxious to get somewhere, to do something... to see you again and show you what I've done.

    This is terrible, I know. I shouldn’t be putting this pressure on you. These responsibilities are mine, and I must do them for me, but somehow you enrich me, and likewise enrich all that I do. Your presence in my mind enhances all I do.

    Still, this childish pining helps nothing, and only adds to my impotence to act. I love you, Tina; but for now I must put you somewhat out of my mind, as you must abandon me, to attack the problems of the day. Soon, always soon, we will be together again.

    "Do you want anything to drink?" Ned asked Sue, sitting in her apartment.
        She looked up from the class notes she was copying over and looked at him blankly.
    "Water maybe? Or how about orange juice?" Ned continued.
    "Do you want anything?" Sue asked.
    "Yeah, I'd really like some orange juice."
    "Well, I'll have some too while you're getting it," Sue said, smiling now, and turning back to her notes. But "Oh, I think we're out of juice."
        "There's a can in the freezer."
        "Oh... you don't have to make it. I just want water."

        He made the orange juice, and brought two glasses.

### From Philosophical Reflections on Loss

I've been thinking about Mom.

My Dad died last year. At 89 years old on a Friday in October, after driving together with Mom two hours to Middletown to pick up watch batteries and jewelry findings from another two hours' drive to Long Beach to deliver that handful of things to a jewelry store, they went back home where my Dad started having trouble breathing.

He had heart issues. He was in need of a replacement heart valve according to the doctors. He had to be rushed to the hospital. He had a heart attack in the Emergency room. He was revived but he never regained consciousness. He passed on Sunday night & my Mom & my Brother could sit with him for a few hours Saturday and Sunday.

My Mom & Dad had a connection like none other for 63 years. They danced a life around & about and through each other. They were two beings conjoined, entangled in each other's loving conception of each other. This is the Dance of Discourse, and the happy optimal dance they had!

We must constantly be vigilant when we use words to explain things to ourselves that the words cannot contain the essence of true information. All the tools of language are limited to evoking essence from the subjective experience of the reading.

The original untransmissible essence which inspired the use of a word cannot in itself BE a word because it is that essence which is real, is ontological. That is, what is real is exactly every experience of any Being.

"Who am I" is the ontological question. "Why am I" is another expression of this ontological question, "What am I?"

Without IT being an answer, the fact, the experience of the question is proof of a significant truth in the fact of ontology. Existence is real because I can ask this question. What my senses are presenting one may or may not really be what I think it is, but the objects my senses remind me of are all in the model of my world, in my subjective mind.

I just had a CAT Scan in preparation for my sinus surgery, to remove nasal polyps. I’m in the waiting room, waiting to get the CD with the scan data on it. 

Yesterday was Father’s day. Hilary and I went down to see my parents. Hung out in the backyard with our dogs, ate vegetarian Chinese food and hung out.

Filling up time. A universe of moments. We all have the same number of moments, just seen from each of our unique perspectives.

Now that I’m writing, I realize I haven’t been writing much. So much to say, but who am I talking to? Setting perspective, my current moment, informing a nebulous future.

I so want to understand physics. I want to be able to put how I feel into perspective with what I am.

My head is vibrating just a little, I imagine. It’s never exactly from the X-rays, but what does that mean?

Wanderlust 2019 - Sunday Night

Waiting.  
Only one form of enhancement. No drinking, of course. And to preserve my sense of smell, no smoking... or edibles. Or whatever.

I feel enormously appreciated... for drumming, for doing Sanctuary, for conversations, for playing music. But... I wish Hilary were here and... well... I was going to say I wished she appreciated the Burn experience, but I’m not sure that’s really what I mean. Because I don’t disagree with her reasoning.

I was different when I started doing burns, and I was looking for a community that liked the things I liked, and I was very tolerant of other aspects of the community, in order to find an interest within an interesting community. Now, being here avoiding so many of the bonding rituals around substances, I do feel a distance. A... why am I here feeling.

Tired of waiting took my 2 gbs. That should do it. It’ll do something anyway.

Watching Dr. Who while Hilary is working on the web site.

And I’m thinking—about things.

For the site, I want to create other ways to support the studio and the community project.

And I’ve been mulling QBism, primes, and a new “Bullseye” probability game, that takes as input a tuple of numbers between -1 and 1, which, if the numbers are truly random, approach e.

An app. What would the prime number explorer + Bullseye game + QBism probabilities look like?

I think I’m on to something.

Written language consciousness derived systems work top-down. There’s control centrally to agents in the wider field.

In nature systems tend to be bottom up. The control is mediated at the peripheries. Communicative networks delay this into activity similar to central control.

Written language systems can coop most conscious minds trapped in written language belief syndrome – but some can see their way through to a single alternative only visible by stepping out of the written language assumptions.

The primary gift of our intelligence is to understand the emotional coordinates of other beings.

Intelligence also has the ability to dismiss this very connection and commonality.

That is the primary crisis of our era, the failure of the intellectual postulates to keep an intellectual model of existence consistent or complete.

I suppose I intended to write something Saturday... but it didn’t make it.

Writing results from a few things coming together, and intention and opportunity meet somewhere outside of my mind.

Where is my mind? If it isn’t in space at all, it is in a different space than the space my body is in.

If space is a universe that contains my body, then Time is a universe that contains my mind.

We Humans can Change Everything Peacefully  
No privacy – Everyone has the right to see everything anyone ever does  
Humans became bored with fire  
Humans cheated and so forgot they were human and thought themselves people.

We must now forgive our ancestors, our parents, and ourselves  
And remember we are all human.

By not permitting ourselves to hide what we are ashamed of, we can start to forgive ourselves, and everyone else.

We suffer our own privacy from when we learn we have anything to be ashamed of.

### From Who Am I? to Conservation of Agency Notebook

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 442 | Date: 2024-02-22*

Who Am I?

Every sentence is both an answer and an echo of that question.

Indeed, what we accept as the answer to that question is the form of ourself that we think we are, and the echo of that form is what we think the world we live in is.

Each moment, we have a unit of Agency, which must be used each conscious moment.

Only a single subject can experience Consciousness. Agency implies a conscious experience takes place, one moment of consciousness at a time. If Agency of more than one Being are tuned through some resonant signals, then multiple beings can act as one Being and all can be modelled through the Agency of layers of Being.

2

Why is it so hard for people to understand the world, when so many other natural biological creatures seem to be shaped by their DNA to know how to use their agency in the world?

I don't feel I can really understand the world, but I can see how the world works inside myself. While many scales with great accuracy through instruments we can observe many types of agency at many levels from the outside, each person has only a single subject where they can research how Being works on the inside.

3

Language, as we know it in the 21st century, is at best a hostile witness. It is a powerful tool to multiply your knowledge by the word of how people going back through history. However, the way it is used is unpredictable and most of the time difficult to come by how the styles of understanding language are all too easily manipulated en masse, which defeats the purpose of actual common usages.

This is indeed foretold in the story of the tower of Babel. But the way language as the tool designed by humans most specifically in written language has now become the motivating factor in how persons use the agendas of people as tools to do written goals.

5

Conservation of Agency

Using the Being in a Field of Being model of the world.

All that exists and are able to interact through a Field of Being are Beings.

All Beings are resonant on frequencies through a Field of Being.

A Being goes through three Phases in each conscious moment.

Interaction → Sense Field Change
Integration → Understand Change
Reaction → Make Field Change

Interaction with the Field is accessed by conscious agency through a Being's senses. Integration is when memory of the Field is interacted with changes sensed. Reaction is a resulting effect induced by the Being through their corporeal connection to the Field of Being.

I'm being bad but I can't help it. I don't know what to do! I know that person over there drinking coffee slowly, alone at that table, but I don't know his name, and I forgot to nod at him or smile or anything when he saw me see him so... what can I do now? I'm so afraid of him I want to fold up into myself like a turtle in its shell peering out with scaly eyes on a world it is separate from. He makes me cold and scared of turning around for he might still be there, waiting for my friendly return. I want to cry and run away and hold Tina tight in my arms, stroke her hair and taste her cool breath surround me in warmth.

"It's just understanding how things work. If you understand, you do what's right."

"It's not a conspiracy."

"I know... everyone knows that."

Connection.

When two people can think of the same idea, without knowing each other, without communication.

You know you are the other person.

You are your thoughts.

You are anywhere your thoughts are.

You are anywhere your light is.

"I feel writing"

Some things I feel proper to do, even when I'm alone.

Some things I feel proper to do, when I'm with people.

If there was no other, it would not be either proper or improper. There would be no proper at all.

We are God, on vacation.

Everybody knows everybody.

You wouldn't steal from someone you know, as long as you trust them.

Your eyes are where you see that's where your mind is focused.

I'm being bad but I can't help it. I don't know what to do! I know I know that person over there drinking coffee slowly alone at that table, but I don't know his name, and I forgot to nod at him, or smile or anything when he saw me see him, so... what can I do now? I'm so afraid of him I want to fold up into myself like a turtle in its shell peering out with scaley eyes on a world it is separate from. He makes me cold and scared of turning around, for he might still be there, waiting for my friendly return. I want to cry and run away and hold Tina tight in my arms, stroke her hair, and taste her cool breath surround me in warmth.

I'm Tem, I live here. I'm from a planet called South Zaxor, 
though I've been flitting around the universe a bit. South Zaxor 
is in another rather small galaxy. In that galaxy I've also spent 
some time on Lamen, Pockhon, Sarb, and the wonderful world of Maec 
before finding my way to Earth.
   On South Zaxor, I became the 256th Recklesh, which is an honor 
as well as a serious responsibility. It has to do with the Barneygrape 
harvest...but I think that should be left for another note.

I didn't start out interested in Philosophy, I remember being

It seemed like wherever I turned, the same philosophical questions 
kept smacking me in the face. Further, I was writing these notebooks

I remember telling a philosophy professor that my central goal in 
doing graduate philosophy was to figure out what my notebooks were 
saying.
   That's probably why I still haven't finished my thesis. That

   For me, Philosophy is the study of/obsession towards/love of 
first questions. In any field, there are some set of premises which 
separate that field from others, and which define the possible results 
and ideals of the field. This is the "Philosophy of ..."
   According to Husserl and Hegel (each in their own way) the starting 
point for philosophy in general, and therefore all other fields, 
is phenomenology. Husserl called it "The Science of Sciences", but 
that's another note, I suppose.

   I like that!! So true. Philosophy sorts out all the confusion 
in the our day to day, minute to minute interaction with the world. 
People need to understand the "philosophy" of their own experience of 
the world. That means an integration of all the different environments 
and attitudes that our civilization demands that we move through. 
Without active thought, it is too easy to become fragmented and 
disconnected from reality.

 .13> BTW, how is philosophy viewed in your universe, Tem Noon? What does 
      it mean to you?
   Hmmm...tricky question, now that I think about it. In general, 
I'd say those most in need of some philosophical contemplation are 
those least likely to take the time and energy to do it, and those 
who think about it the most are the least likely to do anything 
practical with it...but maybe that's not so different from Earth, 
is it?
   There are many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems 
around and about the galaxy, but these can be divided into two basic 
philosophical schools which are practically opposites of each other. 
Most people who understand one well can't make heads or tails of the 
other, which makes it difficult to compare the two objectively. I won't 
bother trying to do the impossible. You may surmise which side I 
fall on.
   There is the Lamish school, and the Maec school.
   Lamen is the largest inhabited planet close to the center of the 
galaxy. Known mostly for the city of the same name which occupies half 
of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

### From Thinking in Written Language

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 736 | Date: 2025-04-06*

**To understand how the world I see around me works,**  
I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what I can sense and what specific details they reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see, to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history with information about how models were built and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books, even if I learned things of good use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is through observing my body, my interaction, and my conscious context at the current moment.


---


**Consciousness is a name for my mental state**  
when I am aware.  
I have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  
Consciousness connects to each person’s experience.


---


**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  
with hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.


---


**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.


---


**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.


---


**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

I have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  
Consciousness connects to each person’s experience.

**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  
with hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.


---


**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.


---


**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.


---


**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

I think I'm on to something.

Written language consciousness derived systems work top-down. There is control centrally to agents in the wider field.

In mature systems tend to be bottom-up. The control is mediated at the peripheries. Communication networks allow this to act very similar to central control.

Written language systems can co-opt most other systems within conscious minds forged in written language belief structures - but some can see their way through to a simple alternative, only visible by stepping out of the written language assumptions.

The primary gift of our intelligence is to understand the emotional coordinates of other beings.

Intelligence also has the ability to dismiss this very connection and commonality.

That is the primary crisis of our era, the failure of the intellectual class always to keep an intellectual model of existence consistent or complete.

I suppose I intended to write something Saturday... but it didn't make it.

Writing results from a few things coming together, and intention and opportunity meet somewhere outside of my mind.

Where is my mind? If it's in space at all, it is a different than the space my body is in.

If space is a universe that contains my body,

Then Time is a universe that contains my mind.

We've scratched as much as we could.

We're recently thought about less than we ever have in the history of our species, and therefore have been more caught up in it than ever before. We are also in the position for the first time in history to overcome the fundamental problem and turn this earth into a paradise of love, life and freedom for all. If we don't, we will evaporate into a dusty cosmic snowflake of death within fifty years. Maybe within twenty.

I'm for paradise.

Here's [scratched out] the problem what it does to us, how we can get rid of it forever, and life without it.

### From White RPI Notebook Recognizing

*Quality: 0.60 | Words: 489 | Date: 2024-02-03*

Introduction

This is my theory notebook, kept through the fall of 1980. I kept it around for when I'd get crazy ideas. Therefore, lots of the ideas are crazy.
Some of the ideas, I think, are interesting. Either way, this notebook gives a pretty fair overview of what I refer to as "theory."

Anyway, read what you think is interesting. I've tried to remember to put titles on these, but I've often forgot. I'd suggest looking at pages:
3 - The two forces
5 - Detection of movement & time
- Religion
16 - Facts & language
22 - Where are we?
23 - Universe of one charge
24 - Antimatter?
25 - Boundary of time (especially In Addition)
26 - Energy attracts Mass
27 - Unit of Time
42 - Energy transmission
44 - One at a time
45 - Representation of a person
51 - Antimatter Radiation & Time

The world is measured in discrete quanta. There are two types of quanta which exist in a complementary relationship, such that they constantly becom[e] the other in some regular time interval (frequency) and space interval (wavelength).

All real particles exhibit properties based on the balance of excess mass and energy quanta.

All energy quanta is balanced by an[other] correspond[ing] mass quanta, which are the inverse of one another. The energy quanta balance the charges in time between all similarly separate masses.

2 Types of Particles

There are two types of particles:
Those that have mass,
And those that don't.

A particle which has mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular place in space. This particle, (balanced in time)* will always be at rest in space (in its own reference frame). This particle will move at constant velocity in time.
The constant velocity particles move in time in their own frames of reference is equal to the so-called speed of light.

A particle which has no mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular instant in time. This particle (balanced in space)* will always be at rest in time (in its own frame of reference). This particle will move at constant velocity in space.
This constant velocity is also the speed of light.

Rest particles have characteristics of both mass and massless particles. They have velocity components in space and in time. The effects of changing the values of the components, and the interdependence due to the physical fact that it is a single vector (measured by both axes) cause all forces and their effects.

*both mean roughly "undisturbed"

Time and Space

It is possible to talk about Time without space. It is not possible however, to talk about space, without assumptions of time being made.

Time itself is not instantaneous. It propagates through space from one particle to another.
Each particle* moves from one value of time to the next.

* "particles" written with an overline, indicating a correction or emphasis.

If we think of thinking as what we do with words in our minds, then we are limited. Words do not occur in our minds alone, they stream through our thoughts in sentences. Whether we read a sentence, hear a sentence, or think a sentence to ourselves, it requires time. Conscious time. Every day, during our waking hours, our thoughts are limited by the number of sentences our mind can recognize. More or less 10,000 sentences, max.

This limit, a type of absolute limit on the sentences any person can process in a day, has consequences. In terms of information processing, the experience of a sentence is conjoined with the meaning of that sentence to the person whose mind experiences the sentence and its meaning. The meaning of a sentence to an individual is wrapped up with the model of that person’s world and the world is a wide assortment of other people. More specifically, sentences are meaningful in the context of a person’s relationships with other people through a lifetime of discourse.

We spend our lives reading a book we call "My Life," with each moment passing through in addition to what happens we are probably going to understand today in the context of all the sentences we’ve heard, said, or seen, somewhere that adds to what I know about where I am in this book I call "My Life."

Language doesn’t necessarily force anyone to believe that the words we have heard, the stories we know, define our identity and the foundation of what is possible. But everything we do does.

But written language, specifically languages which entail beliefs in words changes which turns the Being in the motion of time itself into the experience of living one single moment. The experience of living — on its head.

Without written language, language is always resonance with another Being. The context of all spoken gestures or any action, is the moment, what both beings take away is the shared moment with another being.

Writing separates the words from the moment and anchors the meaning to something removed from the moment. The word has a meaning even without being used.

In this way, the internal narrator is born, and our thoughts are not a mix of sense impressions, memories of relevances of events which follow, and teachings and learning from others we live with.

We still sing and dance, perhaps, but the creation of a social identity built on institutions of books requires us to understand ourself and the world in sentences. In so doing, we demote the value of everything we may do which cannot be conveyed in sentences.


---


There is only so much time in a day. It takes about seven seconds to think a sentence. You may be saying the sentence, you may be hearing someone talk, you may be reading an article. You may be taking a shower and thinking about where you left the soap. Only so many sentences.

10,000 sentences is a practical high end of how many sentences you can notice in a day. There are plenty of activities that don’t require sentence-thinking. But even when alone, I notice narratives and even dialogues bubble out of my mind. Perhaps there’s something I want to say to a particular person, and when I form the complete sentence, it occurs to me what they may think of it.

This is a kind of budget. It’s related to the limits of time, but seeing this as a real limit on my own attention.


---


Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world, and our corporeal body. Phenomenology offers and emphasizes first, and a perspective on finding appropriate and precise methodologies.

Mind-body... The intersection is consciousness.

Energy-mass... The intersection is sensation, the complementary change in either.

The generalized relationship is the same, between Mind & Body, between Energy and Mass.

Quantum mechanics treats everything like Energy.
General Relativity treats everything like Mass.

Everything is really both.

We see ourselves as only mass, while the rest of the universe is only energy.
    They see us the same.

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.


THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite


# 4


It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already


# 3


To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.


# 2


other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.


# 3


To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.


# 4


It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

Walter Russell and the Vibrational Physics folks are very inspiring

Stillness Knowing O "Mind of God"

Resonance Sensing OK O spirit/light

Cause and Effect are a part of matching [preserving the Reimann hypothesis?]

The connection between these two states is Being which I would say Consciousness - which is to say time. Being-Consciousness-Time - and everything we must "do" are different names for the same ultimate thing.

The key distinction that the vibrational physics vocabulary and semantics do that is saying to me... [text cuts off] My intuition of existence is enough to prove to me that my subjectivism does serve as part of a universe where my perspective is essential to the whole universe. I am alone to witness the miracle for God. As God, at the Bodhisattva which I am, Birthing A New Moment.

How does Time, work like space with Relativity? Is time really an action taken at the lowest level Being we have beyond the models of the Standard Model?

It is this characteristic of Time that leads to paradoxes because movement in Time (that is, normal movement in the story that we experience regardless of our movement in space) is only movement in an abstract sense. There is no observable in the world which shows that every change E notates through any sense is evidence that time has past and the content of the experience has opportunities to make measurements on events in experience.

So continuing to use Time as a "spacetime" dimension is not really how beings experience their world, therefore Phenomenally we do experience Space as a medium of experiential and there is a chronological opportunity driven by the inescapable resonance of Time itself.

[The Uncertainty Principle]
ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
Establishes a relationship between momentum and space.
Because also Δp = mΔv and Δv = Δx/Δt for some small Δt,
This expresses a relation between space and time.
The momentum of a particle is absolute to itself, but relative to anything else.
As velocity goes to zero, p will go to zero.

[Momentum]
In classical physics, p = mv²
Special Relativity proved that in more general cases,
p = mv/√(1-v²/c²)
The rest of the first equation becomes a function μ(m,v) which at v=0, μ=m.
μ = m/√(1-v²/c²)
Now, \(\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}\) where x is some vector.
If \(\vec{v} ≠ 0\), then in the coordinate system of the vector, it is changing position.

[Definition of a Particle]
A particle occupies a single frame of reference in space, with three coordinates.
The particle can be described by a tensor. The tensor is the transformation of that particle into time.
There must also be a vector in time, which gives the particle an extension in time.
All the qualities of a particle must be couched within the space-time boundaries of what we consider a particle.
The particle must be in motion in space-time. Else it would not be moving in either the space or time phase.
Therefore, the particle has some velocity V_ST, which will mean space-time velocity.
If there is some function f(x,y,z,t) where x, y, and z are dependent variables, and t is independent, where s(x,y,z,t) is the position of the particle at any given time t,
so that V_ST = ds/dt = f'(x,y,z,t)

[Space-Time]
V_ST = f'(x,y,z,t)
m should be the time component of the space-time interval of the particle.
q is the space component of the space-time interval of the particle.

[Time and Space]
The particle, which is represented by coordinates m in a 4x4 space, is immersed in a sea of other particles.
We will assume that the universe as a whole is conservative with respect to both m and q. This means that ∫m_i=0, ∫q_i=q_i.
Mass is a function of time so ∫m(t)dt=0 and q is a function of space, so ∫q(x)dx=0
Mass and charge are the most fundamental properties of a particle. They exist prior to any environmental effects could affect the particle.
Assume that there exists a quanta of mass and charge... a single quanta.
This quanta would be a space-time interval of definite extension in space-time, but could resolve in any way by the two components.
It is possible to have pure mass with no charge OR to have pure charge with no mass.
