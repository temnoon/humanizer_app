I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it, so here I am, on a plane for the first time in... 13+ years... with Molly flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Corrin, and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A Consciousness First Ontology".

Ontology is the study of Being, Being is the action of existence. It also can refer to a being, which is the subject of experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology, then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own (life in particular).

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of the characteristics of existence.

The word is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness itself through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond that, consciousness is an existential stand in a physically interactive manifold.

Is There a Plan in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of notions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so the need to explain and explore what I think the most intricate as well of the word about meaning used in texts and commentaries, see...

Consciousness is first and foremost personal. You, faithful reader, are the being that at this moment is conscious. If you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you, that is your text-speech nexus. It's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time-horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words we translate, them into personal memories and build the past of consciousness. Each sense is a kind of consciousness, each emotion can evoke a particular mode of consciousness.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people's experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions, but the approach used is used here is focused on the writer of this text and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this relative to how to specify exactly what possible the Writing Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

I've been thinking about Mom.

My Dad died last year. At 89 years old on a Friday in October, after driving together with Mom two hours to Middletown to pick up watch batteries and jewelry findings from another two hours' drive to Long Beach to deliver that handful of things to a jewelry store, they went back home where my Dad started having trouble breathing.

He had heart issues. He was in need of a replacement heart valve according to the doctors. He had to be rushed to the hospital. He had a heart attack in the Emergency room. He was revived but he never regained consciousness. He passed on Sunday night & my Mom & my Brother could sit with him for a few hours Saturday and Sunday.

My Mom & Dad had a connection like none other for 63 years. They danced a life around & about and through each other. They were two beings conjoined, entangled in each other's loving conception of each other. This is the Dance of Discourse, and the happy optimal dance they had!

We must constantly be vigilant when we use words to explain things to ourselves that the words cannot contain the essence of true information. All the tools of language are limited to evoking essence from the subjective experience of the reading.

The original untransmissible essence which inspired the use of a word cannot in itself BE a word because it is that essence which is real, is ontological. That is, what is real is exactly every experience of any Being.

"Who am I" is the ontological question. "Why am I" is another expression of this ontological question, "What am I?"

Without IT being an answer, the fact, the experience of the question is proof of a significant truth in the fact of ontology. Existence is real because I can ask this question. What my senses are presenting one may or may not really be what I think it is, but the objects my senses remind me of are all in the model of my world, in my subjective mind.

Summer Journal

My trip starts today, in a sense. A month from my birthday, a new journal bought by my mother as it happens. One more thing to be grateful for. I'll get back to long island before I leave for Tennessee ad points south - but my journey has begun, so huge I am documenting. Creating the narrative. A shadow narrative at best, of the experience.

25th June 2014
26th June 2014

Yeah wrote the date yesterday but then didn't write anything!

Today I've driven with a few people to Hartford Tennessee to see some friends playing for a charity event. They have a Hummus & Tabouli platter and Sushi for the fundraising special. Exactly my food choice. Then those cookies with coffee.

There's a dog named Grandpa. Color B and shape like a Saint Bernard but short hair, mixed in with the hounds. Quietly moves through the crowd, looking for a scratch behind the soft ears (and any other thing).

Sitting on an outdoor deck watching the band, night next to a river. Looking at a large Ulmus tree, among many others, slowly closing the bridge overgrowing the side shift it.

What is consciousness?
How can the issues of consciousness be addressed to help global ecological issues?

What is the experience & supernatural events?
What is transcendental phenomenology?

What is the structure of intersubjectivity?
What is the nature of the observer?

What is the nature of language?

What is the nature of personal experience?

What is the model of the world?

How does Conscious process the meaning of sentences and other events?

<B0|Ψ> dΨ/dt
State of Action
Being in its own purity
Hilbert Space
(relative to all other Beings)
dΨ^2/dt^2

When I am writing, I am building a software structure from which my intended audience should be able to create an idea.

Beg -> text -> P(B)

General Relativity holds over 4-dimensional space. Its effects can only be measured over large spacetime intervals. Newtonian mechanics is based on 3 dimensions. Electromagnetism: two dimensions. Special Relativity describes the ideal case of one dimension. The only change is in time. No change in space.

What are we?
What is all we need to know?
It has to be simple and exact.
Let's say a particle has an exact space-time position, and an exact velocity (momentum). How could either quantity be determined?
The momentum can be found by crashing the particle against a detector.
This is a change in momentum. An acceleration. This will subsequently change the space the position of the particle.
The position of the particle can be detected by shining a light beam onto it and having it reflect back, but this would change the momentum.

Introduction
Goals
A) Goals of Philosophy
1) Description of reality, including reasons for existence
2) Based on self-consistent axioms
3) Axioms should be as simple as possible.
4) Results should be as far-reaching as possible
B) Goals of Science - Since Newton
1) Satisfied with the description.
2) Also based on self-consistent axioms
3) Increasingly complex mathematics used
   a) tend to overshadow a conceptual understanding of the actual physical phenomena.
4) If a new phenomenon is observed which doesn't fit EX, start a new branch of science with new laws.
C) An ideal result
   1) If there exists one single law governing all phenomena, what would it be?
   2) This would be the most philosophically pleasing result, due to its simplicity (Occam's Razor).
   3) It should also be self-defining (recursive).
   4) It should apply to everything.
D) No compromise

Where are we? Once we develop a system of description of the 'objective universe,' it will always be only a general solution, without specifying the representation of our physical forms.
My view of the universe is that the topography of space-time as described by General Relativity is a framework in which any description of physical forms must be construed.
In infinitesimal regions, the rules of Special Relativity hold. Here, the topography of space-time has been flattened. A particle within a very small region [...]

I've been carrying this notebook around with a specialized title but nothing in it. So here I am, on a plane for the first time in 13+ years with Mom, flying up to Burlington Vermont to see Coop... and I feel like explaining to myself what it is I had in mind regarding "A consciousness first ontology."

Ontology is "the study of Being," Being & the action of existence. It also can refer to a being which is the subject experiencing existence. That is, a Being experiencing Being. Ontology then, is what a Being does when it considers existence in general, or its own life in particular.

In another sense, ontology is an unconscious, or perhaps subconscious, awareness of felt characteristics of existence.

The world is experienced through the filter of consciousness, what we know of the world arrives in a moment of experience, which can only be sensed by consciousness interpreted through the implicit ontology of a specific subject.

I'm thinking about the questions surrounding ontology. All experience supplies evidence of Being which is to say of existence. In this way, since experience implies a conscious experience, then Ontology is only accessible through Consciousness.

But what about Being of other people... and other Beings that are not people. And what about

### From Who Am I? to Conservation of Agency Notebook

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 442 | Date: 2024-02-22*

Who Am I?

Every sentence is both an answer and an echo of that question.

Indeed, what we accept as the answer to that question is the form of ourself that we think we are, and the echo of that form is what we think the world we live in is.

Each moment, we have a unit of Agency, which must be used each conscious moment.

Only a single subject can experience Consciousness. Agency implies a conscious experience takes place, one moment of consciousness at a time. If Agency of more than one Being are tuned through some resonant signals, then multiple beings can act as one Being and all can be modelled through the Agency of layers of Being.

2

Why is it so hard for people to understand the world, when so many other natural biological creatures seem to be shaped by their DNA to know how to use their agency in the world?

I don't feel I can really understand the world, but I can see how the world works inside myself. While many scales with great accuracy through instruments we can observe many types of agency at many levels from the outside, each person has only a single subject where they can research how Being works on the inside.

3

Language, as we know it in the 21st century, is at best a hostile witness. It is a powerful tool to multiply your knowledge by the word of how people going back through history. However, the way it is used is unpredictable and most of the time difficult to come by how the styles of understanding language are all too easily manipulated en masse, which defeats the purpose of actual common usages.

This is indeed foretold in the story of the tower of Babel. But the way language as the tool designed by humans most specifically in written language has now become the motivating factor in how persons use the agendas of people as tools to do written goals.

5

Conservation of Agency

Using the Being in a Field of Being model of the world.

All that exists and are able to interact through a Field of Being are Beings.

All Beings are resonant on frequencies through a Field of Being.

A Being goes through three Phases in each conscious moment.

Interaction → Sense Field Change
Integration → Understand Change
Reaction → Make Field Change

Interaction with the Field is accessed by conscious agency through a Being's senses. Integration is when memory of the Field is interacted with changes sensed. Reaction is a resulting effect induced by the Being through their corporeal connection to the Field of Being.

All systems which define some actions as good and others as bad have a common problem: that the existence and occurrence of the bad actions are as crucial for the system as the existence and occurrence of the good actions. For example, how would an ethical system develop with a basic principle that life is sacred? People simply living together and conflict with each other without a great deal of thought to the particular worth of life until they realized that they have the ability to kill each other at will, for whatever reason. At this point, they would be forced to bring in good and bad, for by saying "life is sacred" it means that saving a life is good, while killing a life is bad.

Utilitarianism is a blatantly dualistic ethical system which expounds the greatest good for the greatest number which implies that some smaller number will be up shit's creek. Pure Hedonistic Utilitarianism, defining the greatest good as pleasure, seeks to minimize pain, but recognizes that to maximize pleasure, pain to some is necessary.

Late for cheeseburgers by candle light, and homemade applesauce, and a wonderful salad and Tahini short cake that tasted like Canada.

Dessert shone through a floating candle globe and ran through pastures of amber. Cleansed by rain, seen through a lens of heat, lifted as ghosts through caverns of heaven.

Back, fumbling for silence and a dark morning. Early for toast and coffee by candle light and still feeling dreams renewed with future touch, I go so that I may return.

I'm being bad but I can't help it. I don't know what to do! I know that person over there drinking coffee slowly, alone at that table, but I don't know his name, and I forgot to nod at him or smile or anything when he saw me see him so... what can I do now? I'm so afraid of him I want to fold up into myself like a turtle in its shell peering out with scaly eyes on a world it is separate from. He makes me cold and scared of turning around for he might still be there, waiting for my friendly return. I want to cry and run away and hold Tina tight in my arms, stroke her hair and taste her cool breath surround me in warmth.

Open... ready to receive.

"It's just understanding how things work. If you understand, you do what's right."

"It's not a conspiracy."

"I know... everyone knows that."

Connection.

When two people can think of the same idea, without knowing each other, without communication.

You know you are the other person.

You are your thoughts.

You are anywhere your thoughts are.

You are anywhere your light is.

"I feel writing"

Some things I feel proper to do, even when I'm alone.

Some things I feel proper to do, when I'm with people.

If there was no other, it would not be either proper or improper. There would be no proper at all.

We are God, on vacation.

Everybody knows everybody.

You wouldn't steal from someone you know, as long as you trust them.

Your eyes are where you see that's where your mind is focused.

The Absolute of Being is You. Every moment You are Being in a two-Fold relation with each Moment.

You = {What you think of the world / What you think of yourself}

You which is, who you think you are in the moment, is how the world is understood by written language consciousness.

For most people, as we relate to other people, we make a model of who we think they are and update it with each subsequent conversation.

Implicitly, in the experience of each moment, we are also conscious of who I am in relation to the other person engaged in discourse. In this way conversation creates identity sentence by sentence.

True meaning, ontological meaning, exists in what you call the sentence, and in the reading of any sentence or token.

The Ontologized Linguistic Unit  
The Experient

A Neural Network / Hilbert Space of Identity = {What I think the world is / What I think I am in that world}

“Time” in itself allows World observation

You are Being.  
You are a Human Being.  
You know yourself as a person.

As a Being, you share essential structures of all Beings.

A Being is Ontologized Because interaction with a corporeal Field of Being.

A Human Being is one of a large planetary biome, creatures, which evolved into Your body.

You are a person, which is a Mask of words, which people believe is what other people think is who a person is. In understanding other people in terms of sentences, we also identify an internal identity. In so doing, we hide from the world behind the mask of who we wish we were.

   According to Husserl and Hegel (each in their own way) the starting

   I like that!! So true. Philosophy sorts out all the confusion 
in the our day to day, minute to minute interaction with the world. 
People need to understand the "philosophy" of their own experience of 
the world. That means an integration of all the different environments 
and attitudes that our civilization demands that we move through. 
Without active thought, it is too easy to become fragmented and 
disconnected from reality.

 .13> BTW, how is philosophy viewed in your universe, Tem Noon? What does 
      it mean to you?
   Hmmm...tricky question, now that I think about it. In general, 
I'd say those most in need of some philosophical contemplation are 
those least likely to take the time and energy to do it, and those 
who think about it the most are the least likely to do anything 
practical with it...but maybe that's not so different from Earth, 
is it?
   There are many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems 
around and about the galaxy, but these can be divided into two basic 
philosophical schools which are practically opposites of each other. 
Most people who understand one well can't make heads or tails of the 
other, which makes it difficult to compare the two objectively. I won't 
bother trying to do the impossible. You may surmise which side I 
fall on.
   There is the Lamish school, and the Maec school.
   Lamen is the largest inhabited planet close to the center of the 
galaxy. Known mostly for the city of the same name which occupies half 
of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

# Chapter 2: The Nature of Being


This chapter explores the interconnected themes that emerge from deep contemplation and personal inquiry.


*22 insights, 11,018 words, quality score: 0.73*


## Section 1



### From Thinking in Written Language

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 664 | Date: 2025-04-06*

**Written Language and Text Consciousness**

The distinction between modern humans and Paleolithic humans is not physical, it is psychological. We now *think in written language*.

By “think in a written language” I mean that we use language as more than a means of expressing ourselves to other people. More than describing events which we’ve witnessed. I use narratives to describe *myself* to *myself*.

Words are a vocabulary shared with all who know the same language, but the *specifics* of what it means are distinct for each person who knows the word. Further, each person uses each word in a different way with each person they interact with.


---


**The modern human uses a model of the world**

that serves the same function as the Paleolithic. Our model of the world works the same as most animals'—when we learn something about the world, we change what we know about the world as we act accordingly.

The model gives us a way of knowing the world around us, of *feeling* physically where we should move, how we should move, what we should do, what we should expect.

[Diagram: event → Awareness → Action → event]


---


**Text is resonated in the consciousness when it is recognized.**  
Thus is the creation of a meaningful text, against the backdrop of a discourse.


---


**We use the same mind to understand the world, but narrative creates the foundation on which our experience of the world is built.**  
The stories we are told and all the media we are exposed to create an environment which seem to imply that the world, as well as our spectrum of expression, are defined by authorities outside and superior in power and time precedence.


---


**Human beings before written language**

used their extraordinary powers of observation and correlation to create an enormously complex model of the world from direct interaction with physicality as well as interactions with other humans, and seeing how they made use of their body, their tools and resources in the environment.

Note that before written language, the basis of the “Paleolithic science” is personal experience, with any communicated knowledge augmented by the personal knowledge base.


---


**Beings exist within a Conservation of Emptiness**

Beings act like a “Box of Emptiness.” Everything within the Being—Receive–Process–Act—results in a new state of Quiescence.

Beings, like animals, have sophisticated senses to receive relevant events, process them in a sophisticated model of the world, and act to make changes to the world in the interest of the Being body.


---


**Meaning**  
An event where a state of Being is changed.

On a small scale — like temperature — being the average energy of the multitude of tiny component molecules.

On a large scale — like gravity — where the movement of mass or energy changes the contour of spacetime throughout the visible universe.

Beings work like this on all levels.

The mechanisms of exactly how it works at different levels differs in details, but it typically includes each being made up of smaller beings, with a simplified order than the larger composite beings.


---


**All Beings are receiving changes from a world outside.**  
All meaningful changes are available (?)

Received energy is perceived as events in the world, evidence in changes in the world.

The act of processing the state change is analogous to each Being maintaining a model of the World, and keeping it updated to match.

Receiving and Processing result in *Acting*.


---


**11/20/2012**  
**Today I will finish a draft — of something!?!**

A first person investigative narrative, following my thought process, touching on all the critical points. I can explain it to people in an hour; I will put it all out — at least outlined — before I leave for Thanksgiving.

Those points —

- Awareness is primal. The *Now*. Planck bubble. The Emptying.
- Beings are Awareness and Bodies.
- Human Beings amplify the primitive universal awareness through the energy of the body including the nervous system and circulatory system.

### From Thinking in Written Language

*Quality: 0.80 | Words: 736 | Date: 2025-04-06*

**To understand how the world I see around me works,**  
I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what I can sense and what specific details they reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I see, to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history with information about how models were built and discovered by science...

But for me to read these books, even if I learned things of good use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is through observing my body, my interaction, and my conscious context at the current moment.


---


**Consciousness is a name for my mental state**  
when I am aware.  
I have a mental state of consciousness that I am using to encounter the world *now*. Consciousness only happens in this way. Consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as subject.  
Consciousness connects to each person’s experience.


---


**The hardest part — starting a new notebook**  
with hopes of making this 64 pages, 32 spreads, will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I’ve been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life. I’ve always felt I knew something that explains what everyone else has been missing.

It doesn’t seem that complicated or unusual, but strangely that it is mostly so obvious that hardly anyone would bother taking note of them… just because we don’t have any reason to notice it is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.


---


**Define the Task**

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describing my frame of reference of the universe, which can be expanded into levels of Being, each described in computable vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no harmonic limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from “First Principles,” and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles the audience will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully optimized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.


---


**Target Audience**

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story those words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions, and other psychological objects which give a personal epistemology of the world — that is, meaning in our life, and what of the world around us is meaningful.

Epistemology is a relationship in every person’s semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is *real* and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying anchor of what it means to *Be* is called *Ontology*.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important.  
I don’t want to exclude anyone because of language I use, but it is equally important to  
**Be Precise**, or at least not be easily misunderstood.


---


**Creating a Formalism**

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper, in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by “science.”

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions, allow as many engineering disciplines to create incredibly large, powerful or useful objects.

What the formalism does *not* do is make any positive statement about what the *nature* of the forces which engineering can now manipulate so masterfully — individual scientists have opinions about what it means, groups of scientists gather around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity, and Time & Consciousness.  
But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

**I need to have a formalisms to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.**

Tricky thing about time, "if my watch is right..."

An alternative definition of simultaneity would involve a postulate about time instead of space. (but a postulate indicated appropriate by the results of relativity)

As a guiding principle, ask "What is the world?" "How do I see it?"

Show there were other legitimate options which were not used for lack of proper considerations.

philosophy of possibilities - phenomenology

"what is" is "becoming what is"

through consciousness

Historical individual -

understanding your own position is very necessary, to do science... to make allowances for one's own behavior of using that to ground his inquiry.

intersubjectivity - your own possibility uncovered by interaction with others

### From Human vs. Person

*Quality: 0.75 | Words: 416 | Date: 2024-01-26*

What is the difference between a Human Being and a Person? I think of myself as a Being first. A Human Being is the specific type of Being, which describes my physical form. A Hominid set of features and capabilities - Arms and legs with distinct functions, hands and feet optimized for a variety of tasks and operations with a sophisticated nervous system connecting the many cells which share a core set of instructions. Hominids have been living on earth roughly over a million years. While their experience of living may have been quite different from the 21st century humans are used to, the bodies and senses were almost the same.

So what is a person? The word person comes from the greek word "persona," which referred to the mask which actors wore over their own faces, which identified the character they were playing in the play. Furthermore, the masks were often fashioned to amplify the voice - like a megaphone, the mouth speaking through an opening cone.

The actor cannot see what others see of them in the mask. To see on stage the actor must see through the mask, eye holes presumably, so the side of the mask pressing into their face or held slightly away is a means of interacting with the other actors even as if the world of the play was the world they were interacting with. Further, the audience as each person watches is creating the scene in their own minds. In this way, they know the characters in the play - see the story unfold, perhaps know how it will play out ending in Tragedy or Comedy.

A million years ago, tool-using hominids were making stone tools to hunt, cut wood and carry fire. They could not yet have had any fixed techniques. They knew the other beings in their environment and used it. With each teaching and learning constant and implicit. Someday, you either now know how to light a fire, or you don't survive. Individuals needed at least small groups to survive. And language was likely not distinguished from knowing and being, with a few shared experiences. It could have been more musical than logical, but meaningful in the experience of the individual Being itself.

We don't know that there is a way to see everything all at once from every perspective. But we do know that there is a way to know all that we know now, as us. For me, that's as me. For you?

Imagine a computer that could see itself, and only itself.
    Would it divide itself, so it could see itself as someone else?

If it all starts with whole states of consciousness, how do we break things up? How do we discern objects? How do we isolate pain to a particular part of our body? How do we control individual parts of our body? How do we store complex activities ready at simple recall, like writing or talking?

Mind is energy. The will into motion. Mind is the spark for all actions, literally!
    The nervous system sends the spark that starts the reaction in the muscles that contracts them.

    "Can you remember your name?"
    A cold, dark room. Little flashing flowed behind, while little ones played, running their fingers over toni.

    A moth fluttered about a shaded bulb hanging from the ceiling.
    "A heavy local dialect, coastal vocabulary."

    Maec dreams, to dream.

    Maec sits in chairs, sits at table, eats food.

    Maec watches pebble fall from top of cliff there to bottom there.
    Maec looks out on a desolate plain. Maec sees tumbled rocks, dead wood, cracked and parched land.
    move arm... move hand... move leg... move foot...
    Maec moves arm... moves hand... Maec moves leg... moves foot.

    Maec picks up rocks, and tosses them into a huge pile off of the plain.
        Hand picks up rocks... hand picks up wood.
    Maec digs canal with shovel and pick, letting water from the lake flow into the fields, giving them fertile life, and making fresh fruits and vegetables which smell pleasant and taste good and feel warm and look of beautiful color.

    dig... and pick... and taste...

    I dig... I pick... I taste...
    I taste... wonderful. I smell beautiful... I feel warm. I feel warm at pleasure. I hear music... I see colorful sunset and I sink and I...

    and I...

    and I am alone and cannot see darkness or anything else and lights flicker on inside.

    Maec walks into building and places a silver on a stone counter surrounding devices to deliver food for money. A large, crunchy apple is handed back.
    Maec eats it.
        I taste happy.

    Maec learns to grow trees and chase rabbits and make a fire and to cook and to converse with other people who look the same and look different from each other. Maec sees mirror.
        I see myself see myself see my... see my... see... see...

    Drink the old juice of grapes and wander through chilling winds laughing.
        Love and feel the smile of pleasure grip me.

    Maec learns...
        I learn...
            I understand these words of Maec.

    Maec eats, to taste.
    Maec smells, to love.
    Maec dreams, to dream.

    Maec sits in chairs, sits at table, eats food.


---


    Maec watches pebble fall from top of cliff there to bottom there.
    Maec looks out on a desolate plain. Maec sees tumbled rocks, dead wood, cracked and parched land.
    move arm... move hand... move leg... move foot...
    Maec moves arm... moves hand... Maec moves leg... moves foot.

    Maec picks up rocks, and tosses them into a huge pile off of the plain.
        Hand picks up rocks... hand picks up wood.
    Maec digs canal with shovel and pick, letting water from the lake flow into the fields, giving them fertile life, and making fresh fruits and vegetables which smell pleasant and taste good and feel warm and look of beautiful color.

    dig... and pick... and taste...

    I dig... I pick... I taste...
    I taste... wonderful. I smell beautiful... I feel warm. I feel warm at pleasure. I hear music... I see colorful sunset and I sink and I...

    and I...

    and I am alone and cannot see darkness or anything else and lights flicker on inside.

    Maec walks into building and places a silver on a stone counter surrounding devices to deliver food for money. A large, crunchy apple is handed back.
    Maec eats it.
        I taste happy.

    Maec learns to grow trees and chase rabbits and make a fire and to cook and to converse with other people who look the same and look different from each other. Maec sees mirror.
        I see myself see myself see my... see my... see... see...

    Drink the old juice of grapes and wander through chilling winds laughing.
        Love and feel the smile of pleasure grip me.

    Maec learns...
        I learn...
            I understand these words of Maec.

My impulse to write has always been a drive to record an important idea that I feel at that moment other people should know. I allow myself to strive for thoughts that explain to me how the world works. I feel compelled to find words I can put on paper that will help others who may be striving to understand the world.

But I step back and consider if whatever I may have thought of, I had read words describing it first, then I would not have had the chance to learn it on my own, and so the words that I read describing the same thing could never really mean the same thing as the thought which I chose them to convey. A paradox.

Ontological Investigations

Ontology is the study of Being itself. The field of study designated as the field of ontology is lived experience. One can speak abstractly about other people’s experience of Being, and use language to make broad generalizations about groups of people and their ontological experiences and opinions. The approach used here is to focus on the being of me, the writer of this text, and the reader, you.

There is something very important about you reading this, relative to how to specify as exactly as possible which Being we are talking about. The writer and the reader create an ontological partnership for the duration of the text. For the writer, they are considering perhaps one, perhaps a few people who will read their words.

Reality is subjective!  
Only Beings are subjects.  
The world as a whole is an inter-subjective world.  
The Objective world is a fiction believed by people.

To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what around me I can sense and what details their specific details reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I use to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history, which inform me about how models were built and discovered by science…

But for me to read these books even if I learned things I could use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my intention, and my conscious context at the current moment.


---


Consciousness is a name for my mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state. I am seeing through to encounter the world now, consciousness only happens now, and in this way, consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

Consciousness is necessarily experienced as the subject of consciousness. Consciousness is the first-person experience.

The New Humanizer.com edition  

We the Humans of the Planet Earth declare our independence from the Legal, Social, and Spiritual responsibilities of Personhood.

Human Beings are corporeal biological living beings. Along with the presence of charge, that is, lived experience are under no obligation to constrain their expression of their deepest and essential identity.

The person (as eloquently described by Alan Watts) is the embodiment of the Greek word *persona*, which was the mask used in ancient Greek theater. The mask was often shaped to also serve as a megaphone. In the current theater of the world, to me, contains that connotation as well, the words a person speaks = *per sona* like through sound!

But not just any sound. Words, people, are expected by their social obligations and expectations to do certain things and not do others through penalty from other People.


---


This is a declaration that there is another way. We are all first a Being, then a Human Being, then a Being in a world of Many Beings of a wide spectrum of lived experiences which teach and empower everyone to the single underlying experience of Time. The change from one experienced moment to the next is what Conscious feels like. Underneath every scrap of context, every sensation from our body or an image imagined, the presence of a force of change in the present is exactly the part of the experience that we experience that absolute inevitability which is Being. The collapse of the Wave Equation is outside of the formalism but we can understand it, because it is what our consciousness is made of.


---


A human who must read into every action they perform as if they were a *persona* is trapped in a puzzle of words! Words not resulting in a person’s belief that stories about what other people think of you will determine all the failures, the successes. You are not obliged to remember the rules. You’ve done what you’ve done, and what others will think of them after.

People go through seduction and betrayal with every belief.

### From Formalism for Universe Description

*Quality: 0.70 | Words: 641 | Date: 2024-01-26*

Creating a Formalism

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by science.

This formalism and ones like it across the many fields of science are necessary so that practical inventions can make use of the precise measurements and predictions to allow as many engineering disciplines to create an incredibly large pool of useful (page not so clear) objects.

What the formalism does not do is make any positive statement about what the ultimate top-level forces which engineering can use actually is unilaterally, traditional scientists have to stay agnostic. It means groups of scientists' action around the various interpretations of Quantum Mechanics and Gravity and Time & Consciousness. But the formalism remains agnostic and aloof from all of the opinions.

I need to have a formalism to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.

Define the Task

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describe my frame of reference of the universe which can be extended into levels of Being, each described in compatible vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from "First principles" and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles, the evidence will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully prioritized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.

Target Audience

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being of sorts, inevitably is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story these words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions and other psychological objects which the story of a person's Epistemology of the word meaning is of meaning in our life, and what the word itself means is meaningful.

Epistemology is in relationship with every person's semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is real and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying expectation of what it means to "BE" is called Ontology.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important, I don't want to exclude anyone because of the words I use but it is equally important to Be Precise, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

[The hardest part starting a new notebook with hopes of making this '4 pages, 2 spreads' will explain the most important ideas I am trying to express.

I've been trying to write this short, simple book for my whole life, I've always felt I knew something but what that thing is, no one else has been missing or even looking.

It doesn't seem that complicated or unusual but strangely that it is worth so obvious that hardly anyone would bother talking waste of their time ... just because we don't have a fancy reason to not live ... is why it can be more important than anything that can be said.]

### From Existential Reflections & Philosophical Musings

*Quality: 0.70 | Words: 306 | Date: 2024-02-01*

It's not that all narratives regarding science, religion, or any systematic model of a physical world is wrong. It is that without the equivalent of the Heart Sutra Science, they cannot be right.

Who are you?
People ask me that, so I have a story I can tell them a few stories really.

But when I ask myself am I asking to be told a story? No, I know those stories. And I know that none of them are true.

So who am I?
And when I ask you and you tell me your story, one of your stories - Do I know you? Do I know a story you told me...

There are many parts to each story, because I have an expectation of what people are wondering about when they ask me who I am.

29 Oct 2014
The paradox of wanting to be helpful and the impossibility of really helping. I can make available words that to me seemed helpful, as I was saying them. As I was writing them. As I was thinking them.

It's hard not to internalize the negative narratives of others. It is even harder to not internalize the positive narratives of others.

Each of us has a feeling of selfness. We also have a feeling of selfness, neither of these perceptions contain our actual self. The feeling is an energetic state of our being at a given space & time. The narrative is a resulting set of actions (physical or mental formation) of the energetic state imagined into an imagined, recraftable form.

But each moment is really on its own. Our relation to Being (the verb) is not the physicality that can be observed but the process of energetic observation. To me, it's a variable, another feeling between Being and an idea of a being at best, distractingly.

*Quality: 0.70 | Words: 422 | Date: 2024-04-13*

The notebook is the pad I carry around waiting for the point of the pen. It doesn't care who is writing, or what is written. It's job is simply to be blank – the horizon against which the pen can cross out thin lines of blankness.

The notebook knows no time. Its pages and lines are equally available at all moments. A notebook is never finished until it is burned or buried or lost – for only then can nothing more be added.

Of course, duplication makes the notebook something else. It freezes a moment in the process that is a notebook. Suddenly, the notebook becomes a book.

So who has control over this? I could say "me," but who is this me? Is it the body which wrote the word down just now, or the "I" extended through time back to my personal birth? Let's just say that I am an individual, self-identical, extended over time, who has control over this? Don't the people who affect what I have at my command also have control, then in this sense, other people within how do I decide how to use it? What to write down about myself? What about the influence of the world – the signs which cause thoughts and actions to erupt from me? Do I really have control over those actions, or are those actions me?

What about dreams or mistakes?

What is this, anyway?

Show you, so that you may judge it, and write a better book.

This book has to be tight – like the new music, like the new movies. It has to hold the attention of the reader to prove its point, that the reader does have ultimate control of what is being read, and thus over themselves. What this book (book now, not notebook anymore) is about is what the world is like as viewed from the perspective you might ask, who am I being? I can answer without any pressure. I am from the perspective of any single being? I would ask you, why shouldn't I? Don't you? If you think you don't – I'd say, it's because you've been listening to what others have been telling you to believe. This doesn't mean that understanding the world and the universe is easy – rather it's hard for different reasons. I'm not saying I have all the answers, but I have glimpsed and can recall a path that satisfies me. This book is my attempt to – [Some words are obscured by ink blotches]

The Usual


---


Changing of the guard on a cool, dark evening sliding into night.

One blue ad thin;
One short and fat;
One thick and twice divided
and... the usual.

All ready for the road.

Spent eighteen dollars today, and have blank pages and empty cold remedies to show for it. Getting close to the edge, I hold my breath and watch dark children dance through street patterns of pleasure and fire in a blue of white McDonald's while eating chunks of chicken, dipped in honey.

At least I gave them some french fries. (Was that right?)


---


You learned of ways to dream that keep the cold in, keeping time from moving very fast or very far.


---


By "letting go" of control of your actions, making the "will to do" primary, you put yourself at the mercy of others' values. "Going with the flow" leads to following those who choose to lead.


---


Feel warm when there are other ants crawling up the wall with me.

Cold, when I'm all alone.


---


The Noema are real objects.

Our consciousness envelops them and gives them motion in time.

We are a tape head, moving down its tape, playing or recording, never both.


---


Intuition precedes it. Intuition is intrinsically whole, therefore (I think) more fundamental than dualistic logic. Aesthetics exists in the domain of Intuition arising out of holistic considerations of balance, order and harmony; therefore more fundamental and a better basis for ethics.


---


"Wrong!"

Ed was in his dark phase, coming down.


---


Not following the lines!


---


All systems which define some actions as good and others as bad have a common problem: that the existence and occurrence of the bad actions are as crucial for the system as the existence and occurrence of the good actions. For example, how would an ethical system develop with a basic principle that life is sacred? People simply living together and conflict with each other without a great deal of thought to the particular worth of life until they realized that they have the ability to kill each other at will, for whatever reason. At this point, they would be forced to bring in good and bad, for by saying "life is sacred" it means that saving a life is good, while killing a life is bad.


---


Utilitarianism is a blatantly dualistic ethical system which expounds the greatest good for the greatest number which implies that some smaller number will be up shit's creek. Pure Hedonistic Utilitarianism, defining the greatest good as pleasure, seeks to minimize pain, but recognizes that to maximize pleasure, pain to some is necessary.


---


An old friend called, and we talked about Samsara and meeting at Thanksgiving, leading to

Late for cheeseburgers by candle light, and homemade applesauce, and a wonderful salad and Tahini short cake that tasted like Canada.

Dessert shone through a floating candle globe and ran through pastures of amber [and the rest of the sentence is crossed out].

Cleansed by rain seen through a lens of heat, lifted as ghosts through caverns of heaven.

Back, fumbling for silence and a dark morning. Early for toast and coffee by candle light and still feeling dreams renewed with future touch, I go so that I may return.

All systems which define some actions as good and others as bad have a common problem: that the existence and occurrence of the bad actions are as crucial for the system as the existence and occurrence of the good actions. For example, how would an ethical system develop with a basic principle that life is sacred? People simply living together and conflict with each other without a great deal of thought to the particular worth of life until they realized that they have the ability to kill each other at will, for whatever reason. At this point, they would be forced to bring in good and bad, for by saying "life is sacred" it means that saving a life is good, while killing a life is bad.

Utilitarianism is a blatantly dualistic ethical system which expounds the greatest good for the greatest number which implies that some smaller number will be up shit's creek. Pure Hedonistic Utilitarianism, defining the greatest good as pleasure, seeks to minimize pain, but recognizes that to maximize pleasure, pain to some is necessary.

An old friend called, and we talked about Samsara and meeting at Thanksgiving, leading to

Late for cheeseburgers by candle light, and homemade applesauce, and a wonderful salad and Tahini short cake that tasted like Canada.

Dessert shone through a floating candle globe and ran through pastures of amber [and the rest of the sentence is crossed out].

Cleansed by rain seen through a lens of heat, lifted as ghosts through caverns of heaven.

Back, fumbling for silence and a dark morning. Early for toast and coffee by candle light and still feeling dreams renewed with future touch, I go so that I may return.

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

flow. As another Zen verse puts it:

If you understand, things are just as they are;  
If you do not understand, things are just as they are.

Now it is widely believed that those who are free from the illusion of separateness are automatically endowed with extraordinary powers, and this is true in the obvious sense that all the wonders of nature are no other than oneself. Beyond this, the gifts of psionic powers (siddhi) may or may not be manifested, just as there may or may not be good weather. In any milieu where the liberated guru is highly revered, people will faith-heal themselves of sickness in his presence, and attribute the cure to his magic. But meditation may be regarded as a state in which the fruits of nature and the potentialities of the human organism may develop more richly, though this will never happen if their growth is forced. So long, then, as we are concerned with powers, we are still aiming at increased control of nature and aggravating our frustrations. I am speaking, needless to say, of a control of nature supposedly imposed from the outside. It is really incorrect to think of nature as controlled, self-controlled, or uncontrolled, for the idea of control always involves a duality in which one element commands and the other obeys, or refuses to obey. The pattern or order of nature depends on no such division, since cause and effect, action and reaction, are simply two aspects or poles of a single process, or two ways of looking at it. No cause is separate from its effect, except for purposes of description in dualistic language.

As a rule, the mystics and gurus who are no longer seeking any attainment go on with what appears to be the formal practices of meditation. The various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are usually depicted in the position of meditating in the padmasana or lotus-posture like any novice, but this is actually a ritual which is done for its own sake—as one might play the flute, or dance, or invite friends to a formal dinner. It is almost ridiculous to ask, "Why meditate?" as if it were going out of one’s way to do something bizarre, like lying on a bed of nails. Why look at the stars or watch clouds? Why go sailing to no fixed destination? Nothing is really explained by its cause or motivation, for we find only causes behind causes until we can pursue them no longer. It is like a child asking "Why? Why? Why?... " until its father, like a Zen master, says, "O shut up and suck your lollipop!"

Thus contemplation as a particular "exercise," done in a formal way, is simply the ritual enjoyment of that basic awareness of what is happening now which goes on always from moment to moment. In the same way, dancing as dancing is the ritual form of dancing while cooking, or dancing with the pen while writing. It is therefore quite against the spirit of such contemplation to undertake it in a mood of grim seriousness as is sometimes the way in monasteries and religious communities which are really schools for adolescents without true vocation to the contemplative life, where young people are drilled in ritual like conscripted soldiers. Children must under no circumstances 


# 11


be forced to participate in such exercises, just as we would not dream of requiring them to engage in sexual intercourse. In such ritual it is equally absurd to treat ourselves as children, and to browbeat ourselves into arduous practice with the thought that it will be good for us. The goal of contemplation is contemplation—not some future result that it may bring.

While there are traditional forms of the contemplative ritual, there are no fixed ways in which it must be done. It has, however, been found appropriate to sit like a Buddha with the legs crossed, or in lotus-posture, with the back easily erect and the breath coming and going on its own as if it were falling out and falling in, not as being pushed out or pulled in.

In the same spirit, one does not listen but simply hears all sounds that are emerging from silence without making any effort to place or identify them. Similarly, one does not look, but only sees light, color, and form playing with the eyes as they, too, emerge moment by moment from the void. Thoughts, likewise, are treated in the same way as sounds, and, if they arise, are merely watched without comment as they come and go, "hearing" them in the same way as one would hear the chattering of birds on the roof.

When the breath subsides into a slow rhythm, it is a special delight to let the voice float a tone upon it, with the sound OM, or the mantra OM AH HUM, and to hear the tone reverberating—perhaps to the accompaniment of a gong which is allowed to hum until its sound fades into all other

sounds. There are many suitable forms of such chanting ritual, employing not only prolonged single tones, but also rhythmic phrases repeated again and again, as for instance the familiar lilting mantra HARI KRISHNA, HARI KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA, HARI HARI; HARI RAMA, HARI RAMA, RAMA RAMA, HARI HARI. What is important here is not the meaning of the words but their actual sound and the movement of the breath and lips, giving direct experience of the basic energy of life as it comes from the void.

It is possible that in the course of contemplation there may arise visions or ecstatic states of consciousness, and it is a natural temptation to think of these as the goals of contemplation. However, to attempt to prolong these states, or to regain them when they subside, is like straining the facial muscles to see clearly, and is an effort to interrupt the natural flow of what is happening now. There may also arise a curious sensitivity to the unspoken thoughts and intentions of others, or astonishing dexterity of intellect or fidelity of memory, but these are not to be taken as signs of "progress" in contemplation, because contemplation ceases as soon as there is any seeking for results. Such temptations as these beset ritual contemplation in the same way as playing a musical instrument may be used for ends extraneous to the enjoyment of music, as in competing with oneself or with others for musical status.

Too much concern for ritual contemplation may also lead to a one-sidedly passive form of life and to the impression of

The Being never moves nor lives. What moves is time is the flickering image of the Being through the Being, with the energy moving through centers of Gravity.

Energy moves in space, material, in time.

Quiescence is a stillness. Everybody has a stillness a quiescence. It is the personal ground which defines at all times where you are. It is not that Quiescence is layers upon layers of vibrations, throbs, referents and refermals,

Upon the ground of stillness, our senses show us a world through a body. Our consciousness puts those events together into a model of the world.

There are two minds which must both be acknowledged when understanding the means of the things we see: The narrative mind and the whole mind.

Beings are time travelers. In fact, they move only in time, in an absolute way. Movement in space is relative.

Light moves only in space, not in time.

Human Beings are beings. We absorb and emit light (as electromagnetic energy).

We move light through time, and light moves us through space.

So, let’s see.

If I were to put it all together, I would want to write about, as always, how the world works.

Be specific. For myself, I want to understand, between my senses and memory what will happen in the future based on what I am seeing now, and what I remember from the past. Who I am is what I know about my path from my memory horizon, and I know about now through my senses. It is my actions that move me into the future. The principle action is time itself, which is that possibility of change, which is Now.

The objectiveness of the outside world is an assumption which is not founded in observation, because all observations are necessarily subjective.

A human being is a biological being which is propelled through a timeline of sensations, actions, and reactions, all of which plays out between corporeal substance from our bodies out into every corner of our imagination.

For us to be asking questions, finding answers and writing them down, it means that we live in a world of language and we mentally spend most of our waking hours and even many movements of our minds into words, then allowing words to evoke movements in our mind which strike us with every emotion we are capable of.

While the benefits of language, and specifically the written languages which have conquered the entire species, are diverse and fundamental to our way of life, it is crucial that we step back and for a moment question what we may have lost by growing so dependent on the modes of thinking demanded by written language consciousness.

What is required for a calculus of consciousness? A model of a Being in a Subjective Field of Being.

Definitions—
Being Energy = Being as a Verb = Be

The amount of Energy embodied in the fundamental cycle of each Being.

Being Mass = Being as a Noun = Bm

The Returned Energy that is not dissipated in the fundamental cycle of each being.

The rate of time is relative to the local time field = gravity field.
The fact of time (consciousness) is an attribute of Being.

Unit of Time

The unit of time is a single value; a scalar. This is the only form of communication across time, in any single closed energy system.

At any single instant in time, there exists values of mass. Every unit of mass which exists in one instant must proceed to the next instant along geodesics in space-time.

In our closed energy system of electromagnetism, every unit of mass also has a quality known as charge*. This charge quality must also be transmitted through the unit of time.

I would like now to emphasize that the unit of time is a messenger provided by space-time, not the mass-energy system. Mass only exists at infinitesimal intervals of time, and depends on the geometry and the unit for existence.

For the unit mass and unit charge, the unit time will be some constant interval ΔS.

Also, the unit of time is a markov process, at that the ΔS depends only on the previous state.

*Noting I purposely do not introduce a distinction of sign of charge.

An Instant of Time and the Inertial Frame of Reference

At some infinitesimal unit of the dΣ, the three space dimensions are not affected by any gravitational field which might exist in the area.

This can be easily visualized by thinking of the action of the gravitational field as a gradient in the rate of change of time.
If time is a changing value, it can be thought of as being a function of some unknown variable \( X(\aleph) \). So we have \( X(\aleph), \frac{d\aleph}{dt} = d\theta \).
Motion purely in space is absolutely forbidden. This would make it possible for objects to be at two or more places in space at the same time simultaneously. This is something not experienced in everyday world and it was a main objective for special relativity to prevent.
This is also intuitively obvious from Newtonian mechanics, since all motion in space is a function of time.

Unit Model.

mass = 1, charge = 1, at some \( t = t_0 \)

There exists an operation which changes the time from \( t = t_0 \) to \( t = t_1 \), 

mass m = 1, \( \text{charge} = q = 1 \) at some \( t = t_1 \),

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
m \\
q \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
m_2 \\
q_e \\
\end{bmatrix} \]

For the coordinates of this unit in time is the product of the matrices.

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix} \] or symbolically, \( \Delta S = X \)

where the matrix A describes the current state of the coordinates x_0, y_0, z_0, t_0, and can be solved either for the change in coordinates, given the final coordinates, or for the final coordinates, given the change in the coordinates.

In this case \( A = I \), the identity matrix indicating that we consider this system as being at rest at the origin of the coordinate system. A physical particle in such a state would have zero kinetic energy. In our universe, this would be how a particle at absolute zero could be represented.

present, and anything in excess of this would be obstructive & redundant—like red ink in a rose. Otherwise, it is simply necessary to see that our usual "I" is a false and impotent image. But just as this phantom cannot actually will or do anything, it cannot get rid of itself. No tensing of muscles or, for that matter, deliberate relaxing of muscles, no repetitions of formulae, no self-suggestion, no exercises of imagination, no psychophysical regimens of any kind will do anything but add strength to the phantom. For every littlest movement to change, or to try not to change, the way you actually feel now will be just one more of those futile muscular tensions (like trying to lift an airliner off the ground by straining at your seat-belt) which give semblance to the reality of the separated ego. You, considered as that ego, cannot get polar vision or cosmic consciousness. It might arise all of itself, as if by divine grace, but there is nothing, just nothing, you can do or not do to bring it about. Yogis and Zen followers sometimes come to this point after long and heroic efforts.

At this point there is nothing to do except what is happening of itself. All that remains is the simple awareness of what is going on—trees outside, street sounds, clock ticking, sunlight on carpet, breathing, body feelings, talking to yourself in your head. Usual cosmic jazz. That's what there is, and every bit of it, including memories and recollections, is happening now. It comes out of nothing as sounds come out of silence, for it should be obvious that the universe has always started from now and left traces behind, like a pen as it writes, though the written record, the seeming past, is still and only now.

present, and anything in excess of this would be obstructive & redundant—like red ink in a rose. Otherwise, it is simply necessary to see that our usual "I" is a false and impotent image. But just as this phantom cannot actually will or do anything, it cannot get rid of itself. No tensing of muscles or, for that matter, deliberate relaxing of muscles, no repetitions of formulae, no self-suggestion, no exercises of imagination, no psychophysical regimens of any kind will do anything but add strength to the phantom. For every littlest movement to change, or to try not to change, the way you actually feel now will be just one more of those futile muscular tensions (like trying to lift an airliner off the ground by straining at your seat-belt) which give semblance to the reality of the separated ego. You, considered as that ego, cannot get polar vision or cosmic consciousness. It might arise all of itself, as if by divine grace, but there is nothing, just nothing, you can do or not do to bring it about. Yogis and Zen followers sometimes come to this point after long and heroic efforts.

At this point there is nothing to do except what is happening of itself. All that remains is the simple awareness of what is going on—trees outside, street sounds, clock ticking, sunlight on carpet, breathing, body feelings, talking to yourself in your head. Usual cosmic jazz. That's what there is, and every bit of it, including memories and recollections, is happening now. It comes out of nothing as sounds come out of silence, for it should be obvious that the universe has always started from now and left traces behind, like a pen as it writes, though the written record, the seeming past, is still and only now.

It took me leaving my place in the castle to get to write in this notebook.

Epistemology -
How is the world meaningful?
What are the structures of knowing?
What is the structure of saying, hearing, and knowing?

29 June 2014
Found a well lighted place to sit and write. On steps lead to the pool table and bathrooms in the back of the club. Lights for the steps, I sit beside. I think I have something to write.

Asheville, Timon's room, heavy electro I think they call it. Many fascinating characters. Lots I already know.

I wore my leather jacket before, now I'm in Swami colors and my Dennis Max cowboy hat, sitting and writing on the steps with my hair down.

And I think about particles. These all too human particles, feeling the world living, understood what that exact witnessed life means and then reacting. Dancing to the music. Dancing for your pleasure.

17 August 2014
The summer, and see how little I've written.

In a diner in Massapequa. Ate my standard candied divers, since I was never here before. Greek salad. But that doesn't matter, I came in because I wanted to do some writing, but only now am I getting to it.

Adirondack came back with coffee and pound cake. But I will carry on.

Do what I promised I was going to do, and everything will be okay. But I haven't been. A few promises have fallen between the cracks. I need to redouble my efforts.

I have three days. Three days to prepare pack and leave for points south. I know I can do it, but I promised to do some things, I need to do them before I leave.

And I need to determine for myself what the plan is.

What is this? I plan on living off what I can scrounge up. Will I live on? How will I eat, pay rent, buy anything? What I can contribute that other people could use?

And what do I think of myself? What is it I have to say for what I've been doing?

The Tale of the Divided I.
The I is the movement between two halves.

I = Me + Everything
I includes models about Me and Everything.

Introduction

This is my theory notebook, kept through the fall of 1980. I kept it around for when I'd get crazy ideas. Therefore, lots of the ideas are crazy.
Some of the ideas, I think, are interesting. Either way, this notebook gives a pretty fair overview of what I refer to as "theory."

Anyway, read what you think is interesting. I've tried to remember to put titles on these, but I've often forgot. I'd suggest looking at pages:
3 - The two forces
5 - Detection of movement & time
- Religion
16 - Facts & language
22 - Where are we?
23 - Universe of one charge
24 - Antimatter?
25 - Boundary of time (especially In Addition)
26 - Energy attracts Mass
27 - Unit of Time
42 - Energy transmission
44 - One at a time
45 - Representation of a person
51 - Antimatter Radiation & Time

The world is measured in discrete quanta. There are two types of quanta which exist in a complementary relationship, such that they constantly becom[e] the other in some regular time interval (frequency) and space interval (wavelength).

All real particles exhibit properties based on the balance of excess mass and energy quanta.

All energy quanta is balanced by an[other] correspond[ing] mass quanta, which are the inverse of one another. The energy quanta balance the charges in time between all similarly separate masses.

2 Types of Particles

There are two types of particles:
Those that have mass,
And those that don't.

A particle which has mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular place in space. This particle, (balanced in time)* will always be at rest in space (in its own reference frame). This particle will move at constant velocity in time.
The constant velocity particles move in time in their own frames of reference is equal to the so-called speed of light.

A particle which has no mass exists in a unique frame of reference, at a particular instant in time. This particle (balanced in space)* will always be at rest in time (in its own frame of reference). This particle will move at constant velocity in space.
This constant velocity is also the speed of light.

Rest particles have characteristics of both mass and massless particles. They have velocity components in space and in time. The effects of changing the values of the components, and the interdependence due to the physical fact that it is a single vector (measured by both axes) cause all forces and their effects.

*both mean roughly "undisturbed"

Time and Space

It is possible to talk about Time without space. It is not possible however, to talk about space, without assumptions of time being made.

Time itself is not instantaneous. It propagates through space from one particle to another.
Each particle* moves from one value of time to the next.

* "particles" written with an overline, indicating a correction or emphasis.

Phenomenology of the Meaning of Books

All Books are Read in a Context

We spend our lives reading a book we call "My Life," with each moment passing through in addition to what happens we are probably going to understand today in the context of all the sentences we've heard, said, or seen somewhere that adds to what I know about where I am in this book I call "My Life."

Language doesn’t necessarily force anyone to believe that the words we have heard before help us define our identity and the foundation of what is possible.

But written language, specifically language which enters the literate words changes which turns the Being, the flow of time itself into the experience of living one single moment, the experience of Living as it is lived.

Without written language, language is always resonance with another Being. The context of all spoken gestures or any action in the moment, what both beings take away is the shared moment with another being.

Writing separates the words from the moment and anchors the meaning to something remote from the moment. The word has a meaning, even without being used.

In this way, the internal narration is born, and our thoughts are now a way of sense impressions, memories of sequences of events which follow, as if we are always singing, dancing, and teaching and learning from others we live with.

We still sing and dance, perhaps, but the creation of a social identity built on institutions of books requires us to understand ourself and the world in sentences. In so doing, we demote the value of everything we may do which cannot be conveyed in sentences.

There is only so much time in a day. It takes about seven seconds to think a sentence. You may be saying the sentence, you may be hearing someone talk, you may be reading an article. You may be taking a shower and thinking about where you left the soap. Only so many sentences.

10,000 sentences is a practical high end of how many sentences you can notice in a day. There are plenty of activities that don’t require sentence thinking. But even when alone, I notice narratives and even dialogues bubble out of my mind. Perhaps there’s something I want to say to a particular person, and when I form the sentence, it occurs to me what they may think of it.

This is a kind of budget. It’s related to the limits of time, but seeing this as a real limit on my own attention.

If we think of thinking as what we do with words in our minds, then we are limited. Words do not occur in our minds alone, they stream through our thoughts in sentences. Whether we read a sentence, hear a sentence, or think a sentence to ourselves, it requires time. Conscious time. Every day, during our waking hours, our thoughts are limited by the number of sentences our mind can recognize. More or less 10,000 sentences, max.

This limit, a type of absolute limit on the sentences any person can process in a day, has consequences. In terms of information processing, the experience of a sentence is conjoined with the meaning of that sentence to the person whose mind experiences the sentence and its meaning. The meaning of a sentence to an individual is wrapped up with the model of that person’s world and the world is a wide assortment of other people. More specifically, sentences are meaningful in the context of a person’s relationships with other people through a lifetime of discourse.

Phenomenology means the study of the most general thing possible, which is the most foundational possible area of study. It is the focus and attention on the flow of conscious phenomena. It is only through our senses and our inner sense of Being that we can know anything that we can understand of the corporeal world, and our corporeal body.

Is There a Flaw in Consciousness?

There is an astounding number of definitions, hypotheses, and theories about what exactly consciousness is, so I will need to explain and explore what I think of as "consciousness", as well as the most intuitive meaning of the word when I see it used in texts and commentary.

Conscious is first and foremost personal; you faithful reader are likely being that at this moment in life, or if you are reading these words, or if they are being read to you. It's your text-to-speech process if it's your text processing consciousness that reads the meaning of those words against the backdrop of your personal time horizon.

But text consciousness recognizes words and translates them into personal memories is only one part of consciousness. Each sense is an end of consciousness, each neuron can evoke a peak-like node of awareness.

At the core of our consciousness is a unifying oneness. Beyond an idea, consciousness is an existential strand in a physically interactive manifold.

Some Solutions.

Let us picture particles in various states of motion:
First, a particle will be considered some volume within which the special theory of relativity will hold, an inertial frame of reference.

We will consider all particles beginning at time \( t_0 \) as being at the origin of space-time.

\[ \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix} \] or \( IX = X \)

This is merely a number which switches the units of time into units of space.

This can easily be generalized for a system which can be solved in general situations for its eigen-values and eigen-vectors.
\[ AX = \lambda X \]

\( \lambda \) being the vector representing the change in space-time coordinates, it's an eigen-vector.
A represents a particle. If the particle is observable, we know that there will be at least one real eigenvalue for which the eigen-vector is also real.

Space-Time

Space-time can be thought of as two mutually perpendicular complex planes.
The parameters of a particle are a combination of the two planes, but in order to measure one, the other must be affected.

The real axes together form electromagnetism, including charge. The imaginary axes contain time, and mass.

The Basics

Q: What are we trying to show?

Speculation: A particle at rest will tend to stay at rest. After any motion, a particle must transform itself back into a coordinate system where it's at rest.

What effect on this has any physical attributes like mass and charge? What effect do the attributes have on the transformation?

Assumption:

All physical properties of a particle must be represented by a matrix of 4 equations in 4 unknowns. They can be thought to represent the boundaries of a region in space-time. The shape of the region, including volume, radius, etc., would determine.

The universe is the sum of all possible tensors in four dimensions (n=4).

The universe can be represented as an n×n matrix of space-time coordinates. The world line of some particle moving through it, as a function of time.

The coordinates of the universe are invariant to causal order.
A new coordinate system for the universe must be created for every point in the matrix.

This is merely a number which switches the units of time into units of space.

This can easily be generalized for a system which can be solved in general situations for its eigen-values and eigen-vectors. \( AX = \lambda X \)

\( \lambda \) being the vector representing the change in space-time coordinates. It's an eigen vector.
A represents a particle. If the particle is observable, we know that there will be at least one real eigen value for which the eigen vector is also real.

Space-Time

Space-time can be thought of as two mutually perpendicular complex planes.
The parameters of a particle are a combination of the two planes, but in order to measure one, the other must be affected.

The real axes together form electromagnetism, including charge. The imaginary axes contain time, and mass.

The Basics

Q: What are we trying to show?

Speculation: A particle at rest will tend to stay at rest. After any motion, a particle must transform itself back into a coordinate system where it's at rest.

What affect on this has any physical attributes like mass and charge? What affect do the attributes have on the transformation?

Assumption:

All physical properties of a particle must be represented by a matrix of 4 equations in 4 unknowns. They can be thought to represent the boundaries of a region in space-time. The shape of the region, including volume, radius, etc, would determine.

The universe is the sum of all possible tensors in four dimensions (n=4).

The universe can be represented as an n×n matrix of space-time coordinates. The world line of some particle moving through it, as a function of time.

The coordinates of the universe are invariant to causal order.
A new coordinate system for the universe must be created for every point in the matrix.

Some Solutions.

Let us picture particles in various states of motion:
First, a particle will be considered some volume within which the special theory of Relativity will hold, an inertial frame of reference.

We will consider all particles beginning at time \( t_0 \) as being at the origin of space-time.

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\Delta x \\
\Delta y \\
\Delta z \\
\Delta t \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
t \\
\end{bmatrix}

The Usual


---


Changing of the guard on a cool, dark evening sliding into night.

One blue ad thin;
One short and fat;
One thick and twice divided
and... the usual.

All ready for the road.

Spent eighteen dollars today, and have blank pages and empty cold remedies to show for it. Getting close to the edge, I hold my breath and watch dark children dance through street patterns of pleasure and fire in a blue of white McDonald's while eating chunks of chicken, dipped in honey.

At least I gave them some french fries. (Was that right?)


---


You learned of ways to dream that keep the cold in, keeping time from moving very fast or very far.


---


By "letting go" of control of your actions, making the "will to do" primary, you put yourself at the mercy of others' values. "Going with the flow" leads to following those who choose to lead.


---


Feel warm when there are other ants crawling up the wall with me.

Cold, when I'm all alone.


---


The Noema are real objects.

Our consciousness envelops them and gives them motion in time.

We are a tape head, moving down its tape, playing or recording, never both.


---


Intuition precedes it. Intuition is intrinsically whole, therefore (I think) more fundamental than dualistic logic. Aesthetics exists in the domain of Intuition arising out of holistic considerations of balance, order and harmony; therefore more fundamental and a better basis for ethics.

"Wrong!"

Ed was in his dark phase, coming down.

absurd attempt to transform the transformer, arising from the illusory distinction of thinker and thought, experiencer and experience.

So long as this subtle confusion remains, one can be beguiled into various ways of trying to meditate, and a competent guru will suggest techniques so clever that their absurdity will be difficult to discover without resolute attempts to follow them through. Furthermore, the aspirations and minor successes of other seekers will compound a collective illusion, and even a mutual one-upmanship contest, of believing that this or that method or guru is, at last, the one that really works. Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind. As the Zen patriarch Seng-ts'an put it:

The wise person does not strive;  
The ignorant man ties himself up...  
If you work on your mind with your mind,  
How can you avoid an immense confusion?

But once it has been explained, you may naturally ask whether it is really necessary to go through all this rigorous folly to dissipate the illusion. You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through. Yet shouldn’t it be clear that the very question "Is it necessary in order to dissipate?" arises directly from the illusion itself?

to a zero, which is not nothing, but a starting point, where life can begin.

In our daily lives, for the most part, time is also conserved. We get up in the morning, go to school, or work, or whatever, do whatever we do, and eventually go home at night to the same bed. A circle in space and time. In this case, it is possible to consider that bed as the time source, so however far you traveled from it, time was conserved and you went back. Any paths that involve closed paths conserve time. The earth's orbit around the sun is such a path. Each of our own paths around the axis of the earth as it spins each day is another such path.

If you take a bottle of baby shampoo and shake it, lots of bubbles of all different sizes will appear uniformly. If the bottle is left to settle, the larger bubbles quickly move to the surface of the liquid, while the smaller bubbles will move more slowly upward. This is more than just a weird way to bide your time in the shower, it is an interesting case of Conservation of Time. What we see as the bubble is actually only the absence of shampoo. The bubble is defined by the liquid along the outside of it. What we see as the bubble moving up is actually the liquid moving down. Time is conserved. This is also a good example of the vector property of time. General Relativity shows that in a gravitational field, time is directed opposite the force of gravity. This is illustrated by the bubbles moving up. Other examples of time vectors are candles, where the flame always points up, regardless of the orientation of the wick, trees and other plants which grow up regardless of the tilt of the ground they are on, and the magnetic field of the earth, which is far longer away from the sun than towards it. (like a flame.)

Before I begin discussing philosophical implications of Conservation of Time, I must include a brief description of some of the scientific aspects.

As I stated the conservation, it sounds a great deal like Newton's third law, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." Newton's actions and reactions pertain to masses and forces, and since Einstein related mass and time, they are indeed equivalent statements. Newton, then, should be credited with the first Conservation of Time theory.

In the world of common experience, the vast majority of particles encountered are electrically neutral, which means that there are an equal number of negative charges and positive charges. Applying Conservation of Time, this seems to indicate that one charge moves in one direction in time, the other in the opposite direction. With an equal number of each, overall time is conserved. Looking at the structure of the atom, this seems likely enough. The center of mass of an atom is in the nucleus which is positive, and the electron which is heading away from the nucleus is negative. The nucleus is the time source for the atom, and the electron rides an isochrone, at rest in time. To move to a higher energy level, which means moving ahead in time and farther away from the nucleus, the electron needs to receive energy. If it moves back in time, it loses energy. Also, two electrons with opposite spins in the same orbital are going opposite directions in time from each other. This simplifies the Pauli Exclusion Principle to the common sense phrasing, only one particle is allowed to be at one place at one time. Each electron orbital is only one place, but two times, each opposite the other. This of course conserves time.

Free neutrons decay in just a few minutes to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. In a nucleus, neutrons supposedly become stable. I believe that actually the strong nuclear force does not cause the neutron to become stable, but bends, curves, and changes time so that time in the nucleus is either halted or slowed down a great deal.

The philosophical implications are many and varied, and at least as important as the scientific implications. I will try to touch on the more important points.

It seems to me that many philosophers could look through all scientific knowledge known to man, seeing every fact meticulously defined by mathematical equation and proven by careful experiment, and still say when they are done, "Terrific, but it doesn't say anything about human consciousness." I cannot separate myself that completely from the universe. My own existence is no different than that of a tree, or an electron, or a quasar. My body and my mind function due to certain principles which might not be fully understood, but I will not limit my own curiosity by saying that they are unknowable. Even if I can't understand something, or no one alive today can understand something, dare I tell future generations that they needn't bother trying? Certainly not. I believe that in time there is nothing that man cannot know or do, so long as we never fear the truth.

Human consciousness is moving in time like any other particle, with some interesting special qualities. It can use information gathered earlier in time to change its own state in the present, and its direction into the future. It also loses track of time at more or less regular intervals. People need to sleep and dream.

During our waking hours, our minds are ticking away some measure of time. Without timekeeping devices, we cannot be sure of exactly how much time has passed over a given interval, but we would notice that time had passed. While we are unconscious, we lose our sense of time totally. I know that I certainly can't tell the difference between sleeping for a half hour and sleeping for twenty-four hours. As far as our waking consciousness knows, we stop in time while we sleep.

Then, there are dreams. Dreams certainly exist, and take time, but it is very hard to relate time in a dream to time in real life. There is nothing to use as a standard which is constant to both worlds. They seem to be some sort of opposites of each other. Well, that is how I see it. If we assume we move forward in time while awake, (which seems somewhat arbitrary) then while we dream, we are moving backward in time. This seems a satisfactory conclusion, being that dreams generally consist of past memories jumbled into a new arrangement. So even in human consciousness, time is conserved. Herein lies our immortality.

Being born is like turning on a lightbulb. Time is being given off by every point of mass. The light from the bulb stays at a constant time, propagating in all directions. A baby who

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

I'm getting bored with writing.

It's because I'm hardly saying anything at all.

Of course, maybe that's something, in itself.

It is impossible to determine exactly where my tax dollar (this one here with a little rip under the left one) goes. It completely loses its identity in the coffers of the government.

Universality of aesthetics

People have different likes and dislikes but there is something in aesthetics which is universal. Musical laws are true for everyone. Beauty is often culturally bound, but balance is universal.


---


An intuitive understanding of aesthetics exists in all people but for rational minds to use aesthetics, it must be exercised.

Analysis is necessary in aesthetics to fully understand actions in the world. Judgments of actions are far more meaningful when people in general and the subjects of the action in particular are known. Facts rationally correlated and understood are essential to any ethical theory. Still, an aesthetic understanding is necessary using the results of the analysis in an aesthetic judgment.


---


"Social Artists"
- Everyone should be such an artist.


---


Utilitarianism asks you to step back from the world and analyze an action by extrapolating the probable results of the action. Therefore, the Utilitarian decision is one not made in the world as it is, but a decision made in an abstracted world of the future using analysis of as many facts as are deemed appropriate. An aesthetic decision would be based as much as possible on acting in the world, and an intuitive understanding of them.

A wonderful weekend, with a sword poised over both our heads.
I should have been stronger.

I should have made her work!
I should have made myself work.

But it all seemed such a perfect picture, as we flowed through the world with each other, at hand. And we never forgot what had to be done. It was always there, when we were ready for it.

Now, we're back to business. Let's show them we can play their game too, so we can get back to ours. It will be even prettier, next time.

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.


THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already


# 3


To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.


THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.


# 3


To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present.

And - Strangely enough - I felt like God. Not "God" like the character in a story written a long time ago who if you eat and get the crystal energetic bacon but it is the light and presence that is the light in my eye seeing that light.

I went home and I tried to write down what I had seen, what I had felt, and it was inadequate. In the next year and a half, I wrote down revelations, I scribbled diagrams, I was trying to somehow convey in words, in metrics, and diagrams what I had learned in an instant, looking at that street light. I showed my work to my friends, and they didn't get it, showed it to my professors, and they told me to do my homework. I was getting discouraged until the first day of my first class in Buddhism.

Something in that class told me I wasn't alone. What I saw wasn't unique to me. This guy, the Buddha, saw it too. He was just a regular guy who noticed an extraordinary thing that was there all along. That is hidden everything yet is not visible. Ironically paradoxically it is the essence of vision itself.

Religions are the organizations built around spiritual experiences that other people have had. They come with stories that give a vocabulary to these experiences and the institutions of religion offer these stories to people who then use the vocabularies to explain and to a certain extent, constrain their own encounters with their own inner spiritual life. Science is not very different except that it develops stories about how the senses work and supplies a vocabulary to explain the world as it arrives at your senses.

For me, Buddhism is both and yet neither a religion nor a science. It does supply a useful framework and vocabulary to organize spiritual experience, it also offers a framework and vocabulary for organizing rigorous observation of the sensual world. Yet, the highest value in Buddhism is on personal practice, personal experience. It is through meditation that one is advised to watch the subtle workings of one's own mind. Below the wordy narration of life when people think of as "me", there is an energetic presence - What is me except an energetic presence? That is a void. It is emptiness as a dynamic force, not in a sense of a concrete thing, but in turning back to see what & who has decayed.

What has not changed is the inadequacy of words describing my experience. At best, it is all a metaphor. At best, Religion & Science alike are metaphors for what you are experiencing now as you trust in these words. You may be reading truth from a text, religious, scientific, or otherwise - but it is the inherent spiritual essence which is creating that truth, now in your mind.

May these words be a catalyst for your own truth, support for your own insights which are too subtle, and too precise to be put into words.

Truth cannot be written. It can only be read for it is the mind of the reader, the mind of the one who observes, who creates it. The sun has risen. Another day begins. Anyone can describe the sun, but only your energetic presence can feel it on your skin. Spirituality is presence that religions can only write about.

### From Time Conservation Request

to a zero, which is not nothing, but a starting point, where life can begin.

In our daily lives, for the most part, time is also conserved. We get up in the morning, go to school, or work, or whatever, do whatever we do, and eventually go home at night to the same bed. A circle in space and time. In this case, it is possible to consider that bed as the time source, so however far you traveled from it, time was conserved and you went back. Any paths that involve closed paths conserve time. The earth's orbit around the sun is such a path. Each of our own paths around the axis of the earth as it spins each day is another such path.

If you take a bottle of baby shampoo and shake it, lots of bubbles of all different sizes will appear uniformly. If the bottle is left to settle, the larger bubbles quickly move to the surface of the liquid, while the smaller bubbles will move more slowly upward. This is more than just a weird way to bide your time in the shower, it is an interesting case of Conservation of Time. What we see as the bubble is actually only the absence of shampoo. The bubble is defined by the liquid along the outside of it. What we see as the bubble moving up is actually the liquid moving down. Time is conserved. This is also a good example of the vector property of time. General Relativity shows that in a gravitational field, time is directed opposite the force of gravity. This is illustrated by the bubbles moving up. Other examples of time vectors are candles, where the flame always points up, regardless of the orientation of the wick, trees and other plants which grow up regardless of the tilt of the ground they are on, and the magnetic field of the earth, which is far longer away from the sun than towards it. (like a flame.)

Before I begin discussing philosophical implications of Conservation of time, I must include a brief description of some of the scientific aspects.

As I stated the conservation, it sounds a great deal like Newton's third law, "For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction." Newton's actions and reactions pertain to masses and forces, and since Einstein related mass and time, they are indeed equivalent statements. Newton, then, should be credited with the first Conservation of Time theory.

In the world of common experience, the vast majority of particles encountered are electrically neutral, which means that there are an equal number of negative charges and positive charges. Applying Conservation of Time, this seems to indicate that one charge moves in one direction in time, the other in the opposite direction. With an equal number of each, overall time is conserved. Looking at the structure of the atom, this seems likely enough. The center of mass of an atom is in the nucleus which is positive, and the electron which is heading away from the nucleus is negative. The nucleus is the time source for the atom, and the electron rides an isochrone, at rest in time. To move to a higher energy level, which means moving ahead in time and farther away from the nucleus, the electron needs to receive energy. If it moves back in time, it loses energy. Also, two electrons with opposite spins in the same orbital are going opposite directions in time from each other. This simplifies the Pauli Exclusion Principle to the commonsense phrasing, only one particle is allowed to be at one place at one time. Each electron orbital is only one place, but two times, each opposite the other. This of course conserves time.

Free neutrons decay in just a few minutes to a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. In a nucleus, neutrons supposedly become stable. I believe that actually the strong nuclear force does not cause the neutron to become stable, but bends, curves, and changes time so that time in the nucleus is either halted or slowed down a great deal.

The philosophical implications are many and varied, and at least as important as the scientific implications. I will try to touch on the more important points.

It seems to me that many philosophers could look through all scientific knowledge known to man, seeing every fact meticulously defined by mathematical equation and proven by careful experiment, and still say when they are done, "Terrific, but it doesn't say anything about human consciousness." I cannot separate myself that completely from the universe. My own existence is no different than that of a tree, or an electron, or a quasar. My body and my mind function due to certain principles which might not be fully understood, but I will not limit my own curiosity by saying that they are unknowable. Even if I can't understand something, or no one alive today can understand something, dare I tell future generations that they needn't bother trying? Certainly not. I believe that in time there is nothing that man cannot know or do, so long as

you may feel completely non-plussed and confounded, as if—as they say in Zen—you were a mosquito trying to bite an iron bull. However, this feeling is precisely the sensation that there is no separate self which can either do or not do anything about the problem. Thus it may appear, further, that if there is no distinct ego to be non-plussed, the stream of experience can simply flow on unobstructedly by itself. Hence the verse:

Blue mountains are of themselves blue mountains;  
White clouds are of themselves white clouds.

This unobstructed flow is the Tao, the way or course of nature, and is also what is meant by the state of non-attachment—a spontaneous, unforced, and unblocked flowing of life. Yet the prospect of such flowing as a way of life gives us intense moral anxiety, for at once there are qualms about unleashing the tigers and demons within us if no control is exercised. But such qualms are, again, symptoms of the same old illusion. What if there has been no controlling self all along? Consider, too, whether the human condition could be much more depraved than it is already, and mark the horrendous behavior of people who believe in will-power and in control over their minds and their circumstances.

### From Being in Field Framework

*Quality: 0.40 | Words: 145 | Date: 2024-01-27*

How does Time, work like space with Relativity? Is time really an action taken at the lowest level Being we have beyond the models of the Standard Model?

It is this characteristic of Time that leads to paradoxes because movement in Time (that is, normal movement in the story that we experience regardless of our movement in space) is only movement in an abstract sense. There is no observable in the world which shows that every change E notates through any sense is evidence that time has past and the content of the experience has opportunities to make measurements on events in experience.

So continuing to use Time as a "spacetime" dimension is not really how beings experience their world, therefore Phenomenally we do experience Space as a medium of experiential and there is a chronological opportunity driven by the inescapable resonance of Time itself.

Most of the time we aren't thinking about who we are. We are just Being. That means as consciousness performs a chronological operation on a Field of Consciousness which includes a world, a Field of Being, and an internal "theoretical" account of a world of Being and a range of other worlds and spaces of Beings in those Fields of Being, including family, whatever experience which from a specific conscious moment is directed towards.

When we do "think" about who we are, we tend to understand the question to be in the context of "who am I in relation to the world of people that I know." So "how would I describe myself to someone else" forms a way to answer the question of who we may think we are. Ultimately, we may think of ways of describing ourselves to ourselves and may come to believe these internal narratives as true.

However, they can never actually be who we are because most of the time we just Be, not answering an abstract question.

Will you love what I love about me?
Or will you love what I seem to have been?

Will you touch me now,
Watch me grow
Or will you only say
You like me this way

I'm not done, I'm Doing
It's what I'm seeing

A one goal Dance
A two step plunge
But I could not ask
I'll look for a chance

At your service
By your side

What Am I
Saying here?

Are you expected to be
distracted to death,
Till Death we Distract

Marriage to Distraction

People are the text consciousness
yet in their imagination is created
a physicality which people's names
are tied to.

Men can we stop to
avoid self-knowledge
in favor of what others
would think about what
they are doing.

PLEASE
Don't give me
Impossible Love - 3x

Please don't leave me in
Impossible Love - 3x

Please, can we dance?
Will you hold out your hand?
Will you be in my band?

Please don't by any
Impossible Love 3x

pure observers move only in time, not in space, in their own frames of reference.

Motion is observed in others when, relatively, they have a special component to their motion.

Every observer has some momentum vector.

Changing the momentum of an observer unbalances it in its own frame of reference. It must bring itself back to rest.

A frame of reference is a perspective on the universe, at the "point" observer.

The "past" state of the universe, the "present" action of the observer and the resulting "future" state of the universe are all joined together as one at the point observer.

Only changes in momentum can be observed.

The space component of an object is its energy.

The time component of an object is its mass.

Changes in momentum occur due to collisions between objects.

falling away from the eternal now while engaged in other and more strenuous activities. Now the habitual use of muscular tension as the referent for the ego in looking, listening, and willing carries over into the use of natural physical exertion in running, lifting, and hauling so as to make such actions seem entirely different from those which happen "of themselves," spontaneously. Curiously, this sets up, say, in the effort to run, a redundant effort to make the effort, giving the impression that the exertion of running is a direct demonstration of the activity and potency of the ego-image. We have learned, mostly as children, to put on an act of strenuousness while doing strenuous things. Yet efforts to make efforts, being redundant, work against the natural use of muscular energy in such a way that they are self-imposed obstacles, or efforts against effort. It is as if, in pulling, the triceps were to work against the biceps. When this redundant use of effort falls away, it becomes obvious that decisions to do this or that, and the consequent physical actions, happen of themselves like everything else.

For free action is certainly not caused by a purely abstract "I." It emerges from the total intelligence of the organism, in the same way as the growth of the brain and the digestion of food, and it will employ conscious reasoning in situations where reasoning is an appropriate tool. This would perhaps be called biologically or physically "determined" action by those who separate the organism from the rest of the universe, and see it "obeying" or "responding" to "drives" which have first been defined as external to itself.


# 14


But the individual-and-universe has no external or extraneous determinant. The individual may be seen as constrained by natural processes only when viewed out of context as something in but not of its whole environment. Laws and artificial restraints become necessary when, through the illusion of separateness, the individual loses touch with his organic intelligence and feels at odds with his environment. Obviously, the operation of organic intelligence is not to be confused with the false spontaneity of actions deliberately calculated to be at variance with natural order or human law. Social conventions still govern those who go out of their way to oppose them.

In past times all matters concerning the practice of contemplation were considered esoteric or, what amounts in the West to the same thing, heretical—though not every heresy was of this order, and the contemplative way became heresy only as people tried to describe its content. For, speaking in religious language, it would be plain to the contemplative that only God exists, and that there is nothing other than God. For obvious reasons this is a doctrine greatly feared by both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. On the one hand, when it is necessary that the people be exploited and oppressed, it is important to imbue them with a servile mentality. On the other hand, when people are vulgar and greedy, the mere idea that "all is God" or that good and evil are polar is used to justify every wanton excess. It is for this reason that governments forbid the ingestion of hemp flowers and other psychedelic substances, lest immature and half-civilized individuals profane the mysteries. One does not wish noble wines to be used for drunken brawls.

The fiction of the isolated ego or person as the real individual has therefore been implanted to stimulate the feeling of creatureliness and the fear of God. It is likewise advantageous to rulers that the people be blind to the polarity of life and death, and so fear death if they fear not God. But when those who implant this fiction are also its dupes, they seek for themselves as persons the powers which they already enjoy as God, but have forgotten. In this endeavor they resort to such crude wisdom as may be expressed in linear signs, words, and numbers for the government of a non-linear and immeasurably subtle world. And as the person is a linear version of man, confused with the real man, so the linear understanding of the world—with which linear wisdom must deal—is confused with the real world. Only by violence, then, can the real and living world be straightened out, squared away, evened off, boxed into clear-cut categories, and so conformed to the crudities of linear wisdom. Consequently, all the balances and interdependencies of nature are thrown into confusion—to the bewilderment of birds, beasts, and plants, and the befuddlement of man's own non-linear body and brain. In such an emergency it is necessary to take the risks of exposing the illusion of the person and all its works, and to allow what has been esoteric to become generally known.

It is thus that, in contemplation, man discovers himself as inseparable from the cosmos as a whole in both its positive and negative aspects, its appearances and disappearances. Astronomy and physics are therefore theoretical adumbrations of the vastness of our dimensions,


# 15


for it is not simply that we are subordinate parts of the system, but that the entire system is oneself in its full and only true sense. Ordinarily, we may glimpse this truth in a shallowly intellectual way, and consider it as a lofty idea that has little relation to practical affairs and basic emotions. But in contemplation this view is as real and self-evident as breathing, and enables the problems of mundane life to be seen in their true perspective—sub specie aeternitatis—balancing and correcting the usual myopia of exclusive preoccupation with nasty little games and schemes.

Nature, that is, our own true nature, is bringing these preoccupations to a stop by coming forth with the technical power to pursue them on a colossal scale, hitherto unknown. Pursued and magnified with such power, they come swiftly to absurdity and catastrophe—so that their innate contradictions become obvious to all. For we have been trying to harness technology to the impossible game of having positive without negative, defying the principles of that very electricity upon which technology so largely depends. This objective is as illusory as the ego which seeks it.

Thus a time when the objective seems clearly unattainable is a time ripe for the unmasking of that ego—itself the persona-mask which conceals the splendor of our Original Face. When spring comes the buds break out of their husks, the little birds cast off their shells, and young plants burst from their seed-casings.... When there is a crack in the Cosmic Egg, Buddha is about to be born.

This is a Phenomenological perspective on Consciousness.

That means we assume nothing, the field of our experience necessarily interacting with any apparent corporeal world (whether a dream or somehow "actual"), and understanding the world with a personal model built up over days, then weeks, then months, then years of interactive corporeal experience.

We start with where we are in space and see how what we call consciousness is never quite the "thing" we are thinking about, but in fact it is time "itself" seeing through our eyes. What "we" often consider ourself is some person we know in the field of persons and judge those events from a new time, a new context, and if we identify with that idea of that person who we think we are, then we cannot see the clear consciousness of who we are now, in this moment.

That is why we invoke the Brackets of the Phenomenological Epoché.

It's Time to start over.

Suppose you've been taught to understand the workings of people society and overall culture in terms of Belief Systems. You learn a few ideas about each, and somewhere you decide what you believe, who you think you are and you settle down to talk to people who think like you about people you think don't think like you, among other things.

I'm suggesting to put all that aside. What do you believe about belief? What do you believe anything here, or at least what will not ask you or anyone to believe what you are not saying these words to be believed, but to give you a vocabulary about consciousness and what it evokes, what it means to you... and I hope to inspire you a little to step back from thinking anything gained by believing words without understanding fully what the words mean, without having worked the details out yourself.

### From Being in Field Framework

*Quality: 0.30 | Words: 120 | Date: 2024-01-27*

Phenomenology is not an unusual topic for our minds to understand because it is simply a precise name for an activity we are doing literally all the time, yet it is so familiar that it is rare that we contemplate the specific components of our experience of the flow of life. Phenomenology is the study of how consciousness encounters phenomena of the senses. To propose a narrative as "a phenomenology" is to propose writing a description, but usually memorable realizations, structures, and milestones of a personal exploration of the subject through anecdotal adventures. That is what I am laying down for you, a set of marks which to me would describe something like what it may have had in mind.

That is what I am laying down for you, a set of marks which to me would describe something like what it may have had in mind.

Experience is always Now. Otherwise it is a memory of an experience.

The Experience of Phenomena follows a temporal flow of changes we can sense, comprehend their meaning and act to change ourselves (act on) (act within).

I call This a Being. My model Being is myself because it am an example of a Being that I have complete access to, and as much control as I can have on any Being.

I have no reason to assume that there are anything other than Beings in the world I know of me or the entire unseen universe. As my experience insists, I exist.

I am a Being that senses, knows, and Acts, so I know There may be Beings that sense, know and Act.

There may be Beings that sense, know and Act at many levels. I may be made up of many layers of Beings. I may be part of a web of larger Beings.

While the duration and complexity of various Beings at all ranges of levels vary infinitely, the most fundamental attributes are the same across all known, possible, and unknown beings.

A being in the Universe is one which can interact with that universe through resonant frequencies in some medium which is maintained over the Being's fundamental cycle of Time Consciousness.

Everything experienced is driven by the Being's actions, which only individual Beings have access to.

That action defines a cycle of 3 states which cancel to Nothing each full cycle of Being.

[The Uncertainty Principle]
ΔxΔp ≥ ℏ/2
Establishes a relationship between momentum and space.
Because also Δp = mΔv and Δv = Δx/Δt for some small Δt,
This expresses a relation between space and time.
The momentum of a particle is absolute to itself, but relative to anything else.
As velocity goes to zero, p will go to zero.

[Momentum]
In classical physics, p = mv²
Special Relativity proved that in more general cases,
p = mv/√(1-v²/c²)
The rest of the first equation becomes a function μ(m,v) which at v=0, μ=m.
μ = m/√(1-v²/c²)
Now, \(\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{x}}{dt}\) where x is some vector.
If \(\vec{v} ≠ 0\), then in the coordinate system of the vector, it is changing position.

[Definition of a Particle]
A particle occupies a single frame of reference in space, with three coordinates.
The particle can be described by a tensor. The tensor is the transformation of that particle into time.
There must also be a vector in time, which gives the particle an extension in time.
All the qualities of a particle must be couched within the space-time boundaries of what we consider a particle.
The particle must be in motion in space-time. Else it would not be moving in either the space or time phase.
Therefore, the particle has some velocity V_ST, which will mean space-time velocity.
If there is some function f(x,y,z,t) where x, y, and z are dependent variables, and t is independent, where s(x,y,z,t) is the position of the particle at any given time t,
so that V_ST = ds/dt = f'(x,y,z,t)

[Space-Time]
V_ST = f'(x,y,z,t)
m should be the time component of the space-time interval of the particle.
q is the space component of the space-time interval of the particle.

[Time and Space]
The particle, which is represented by coordinates m in a 4x4 space, is immersed in a sea of other particles.
We will assume that the universe as a whole is conservative with respect to both m and q. This means that ∫m_i=0, ∫q_i=q_i.
Mass is a function of time so ∫m(t)dt=0 and q is a function of space, so ∫q(x)dx=0
Mass and charge are the most fundamental properties of a particle. They exist prior to any environmental effects could affect the particle.
Assume that there exists a quanta of mass and charge... a single quanta.
This quanta would be a space-time interval of definite extension in space-time, but could resolve in any way by the two components.
It is possible to have pure mass with no charge OR to have pure charge with no mass.

Our mind is the controller of the body. Every muscle is paired with one neuron to control that muscle. To have perfect control of our minds we must attain perfect control of our bodies.

The nerves from the senses are different pathways than the nerves out to the muscles. Impulses flow only in one direction.

We see in one space, act in another.

Still, for us it "seems" the same subuniverse.


---


An observer with only one time source in its subuniverse can only move one "mass" forward in time.

That one mass forward in time brings all signals from all other subuniverses in. The observer is a perspective of all the universe.

The observer "sees" other subuniverses with the same mass. Through resonance, their rates in time correspond.

motion in time is carried on:
    emag -> (forward)
    (backward) <- gravity

All phenomena are music, created by the time sources.

All time sources should sing as much as they listen.

People are time sources, but there are so few musicians among us these days. We are satisfied to just watch and listen.

Search for reasons. That's what philosophy is for me.

We assume that causes lead to effects because by assuming that, we see our assumptions are verified by seeing causes leading to effects.

We further assume that what we see is in turn caused by some action in the world.

She works here.
That tells us something about her.

We are on our way to the "search for reasons" with her.

We figure we know everything about ourselves. That is the measure we will make of her. Our self is the rule.
