I'm Tem, I live here. I'm from a planet called South Zaxor, 
though I've been flitting around the universe a bit. South Zaxor 
is in another rather small galaxy. In that galaxy I've also spent 
some time on Lamen, Pockhon, Sarb, and the wonderful world of Maec 
before finding my way to Earth.
   On South Zaxor, I became the 256th Recklesh, which is an honor 
as well as a serious responsibility. It has to do with the Barneygrape 
harvest...but I think that should be left for another note.

I didn't start out interested in Philosophy, I remember being 
driven into it in more intense degrees as I wanted other things. 
It seemed like wherever I turned, the same philosophical questions 
kept smacking me in the face. Further, I was writing these notebooks 
(some excerpts in 8.0) that seemed really important, but disjoint. 
I remember telling a philosophy professor that my central goal in 
doing graduate philosophy was to figure out what my notebooks were 
saying.
   That's probably why I still haven't finished my thesis. That 
was an aside from my main study.
   For me, Philosophy is the study of/obsession towards/love of 
first questions. In any field, there are some set of premises which 
separate that field from others, and which define the possible results 
and ideals of the field. This is the "Philosophy of ..."
   According to Husserl and Hegel (each in their own way) the starting 
point for philosophy in general, and therefore all other fields, 
is phenomenology. Husserl called it "The Science of Sciences", but 
that's another note, I suppose.

   I like that!! So true. Philosophy sorts out all the confusion 
in the our day to day, minute to minute interaction with the world. 
People need to understand the "philosophy" of their own experience of 
the world. That means an integration of all the different environments 
and attitudes that our civilization demands that we move through. 
Without active thought, it is too easy to become fragmented and 
disconnected from reality.

 .13> BTW, how is philosophy viewed in your universe, Tem Noon? What does 
      it mean to you?
   Hmmm...tricky question, now that I think about it. In general, 
I'd say those most in need of some philosophical contemplation are 
those least likely to take the time and energy to do it, and those 
who think about it the most are the least likely to do anything 
practical with it...but maybe that's not so different from Earth, 
is it?
   There are many philosophical, religious, and ethical systems 
around and about the galaxy, but these can be divided into two basic 
philosophical schools which are practically opposites of each other. 
Most people who understand one well can't make heads or tails of the 
other, which makes it difficult to compare the two objectively. I won't 
bother trying to do the impossible. You may surmise which side I 
fall on.
   There is the Lamish school, and the Maec school.
   Lamen is the largest inhabited planet close to the center of the 
galaxy. Known mostly for the city of the same name which occupies half 
of the second largest continent, it is the financial and trading center 
of the galaxy, as well as the traditional central hub of communications 
and entertainment for the galaxy. On Lamen, everything of consequence is 
referenced and accessed, if it is not defined, cannot be cross 
referenced and accessed, it cannot be true. Experience is never enough. 
Events have been cataloged for as long as anyone can remember on Lamen, 
and therefore any events which might have happened before events were 
cataloged is an absurd idea. It cannot be true, because Lamen Truth is 
only exactly what has been recorded, entered into the great public record as 
Truth. To argue against such a thing, one had best have a long string 
of sources, well cross referenced. 
   On Maec, it's different. The philosophy of Maec, as taught by Qaec, is based 
on the sanctity of every moment of every being. Maec is a word for 
'text', which is literally the fabric of the universe itself. Each 
being, whether a molecule, a star, a luk-luk bird, or a person, 
is writing, and reading this text of the universe...and each moment 
is recorded not just in some localised 'book', but at every point 
in the universe. The text is alive at every being's point with the 
entire tome (so to speak ;-) of the universe, as seen from that 
necessary and sacred perspective. As events happen, they propagate 
outward, riding waves of time, intersecting other waves of time, 
carrying other event records, which are juxtaposed in the perspectives 
of yet other beings who also add their wills to the cosmic cacophony 
of life.
   I hope that gives some flavor of the culturally dependent parts 
of my philosophical background. I'm afraid it might not add much 
to the questions, 'What is Philosophy'. To the question, a Lamish 
philosopher might answer, "The discovery of the old in the new." 
while a modern Maec philosopher might answer, "The dreaming of new 
in the face of the old".

To understand how the world I see around me works, I first and foremost have to use my senses to inform me about the space around me and what around me I can sense and what details their specific details reveal.

With memory, I can remember enough detail to recognize signs I use to know what may be about to happen. I can also do specific things to change what will happen.

I can read books which tell me stories about history, which inform me about how models were built and discovered by science…

But for me to read these books even if I learned things I could use, I would not understand from the inside how the world works. Only by seeing the action of the world from the inside.

My most direct insights and direct information about the universe is from observing my body, my intention, and my conscious context at the current moment.

Consciousness is a name for my mental state when I am aware I have a mental state. Consciousness is a mental state. I am seeing through to encounter the world now, consciousness only happens now, and in this way, consciousness cannot be detached from the present moment in which it is experienced.

We the Humans of the Planet Earth declare our independence from the Legal, Social, and Spiritual responsibilities of Personhood.

Human Beings are corporeal biological living beings. Along with the presence of charge, that is, lived experience are under no obligation to constrain their expression of their deepest and essential identity.

The person (as eloquently described by Alan Watts) is the embodiment of the Greek word *persona*, which was the mask used in ancient Greek theater. The mask was often shaped to also serve as a megaphone. In the current theater of the world, to me, contains that connotation as well, the words a person speaks = *per sona* like through sound!

But not just any sound. Words, people, are expected by their social obligations and expectations to do certain things and not do others through penalty from other People.

---

This is a declaration that there is another way. We are all first a Being, then a Human Being, then a Being in a world of Many Beings of a wide spectrum of lived experiences which teach and empower everyone to the single underlying experience of Time. The change from one experienced moment to the next is what Conscious feels like. Underneath every scrap of context, every sensation from our body or an image imagined, the presence of a force of change in the present is exactly the part of the experience that we experience that absolute inevitability which is Being. The collapse of the Wave Equation is outside of the formalism but we can understand it, because it is what our consciousness is made of.

---

A human who must read into every action they perform as if they were a *persona* is trapped in a puzzle of words! Words not resulting in a person’s belief that stories about what other people think of you will determine all the failures, the successes. You are not obliged to remember the rules. You’ve done what you’ve done, and what others will think of them after.

### Insight from Formalism for Universe Description
*Quality: 0.70 | Words: 641 | Date: 2024-01-26*

Creating a Formalism

I need to have a formalism to include all levels of Being to describe Beings.

Define the Task

My intention is to describe a plausible approach to describe my frame of reference of the universe which can be extended into levels of Being, each described in compatible vocabularies but allowing for added levels of complexity which each level adds, with no limit to the number of levels.

The approach must begin with foundations from "First principles" and these principles described and justified self-evidently.

From first principles, the evidence will be described and the vocabulary used will be faithfully prioritized to enhance the probabilities the target audience will understand the work.

Target Audience

This work of describing a way to understand the universe as a being of sorts, inevitably is targeted at those who understand written language and who most likely identify their own being as a story these words have meaning through a matrix of discourses with individuals, institutions and other psychological objects which the story of a person's Epistemology of the word meaning is of meaning in our life, and what the word itself means is meaningful.

Epistemology is in relationship with every person's semantic consciousness with their underlying expectation of what is real and what it means to be a living being. The name for this underlying expectation of what it means to "BE" is called Ontology.

Even though the target audience will likely not have an understanding of what I want to use those words for, so explaining my vocabulary is very important, I don't want to exclude anyone because of the words I use but it is equally important to Be Precise, or at least not be easily misunderstood.

The standard model of physics can be written out on a couple of pieces of paper in the form of mathematical equations defining the relationships which can be measured and anticipated by science.

You, as ego, cannot change what you are feeling, and you cannot, effectively, try not to change it. There is simply and only what is happening, including those particular thoughts, images, and tensions which you customarily attributed to the phantom thinker and doer. They persist like echoes, but as it is seen that they are just static in the nervous system and not the work of any central ego, they lose interest, subside, and go away of themselves. Hoping that they will go away is just more static.

If you have understood all this, you are simply aware of what is happening now, and we might call this state meditation or, better, contemplation. But it is not that you are something which is just watching what happens. "What happens" is just using your organism to watch itself. It is the universe centering as a particular being, though it is not necessary to use or insist on this concept, for what is important here is not the idea but the feeling of it. The words are only a special use of noises in the air, marks on paper, or vibrations in the brain.

If this becomes clear, the effort to transform one's own mind should collapse, and along with it the whole illusion that one is a separate center of consciousness to which experience happens and for which these happenings are problematic. This collapse would then become the state of contemplation, the realization that all is One. I may understand this point theoretically, but still there seems to be no change, for which reason I look for some process whereby I can move from theoretical to immediate or intuitive understanding—not recognizing that this is still a subtle form of the

flow. As another Zen verse puts it:

If you understand, things are just as they are;  
If you do not understand, things are just as they are.

Now it is widely believed that those who are free from the illusion of separateness are automatically endowed with extraordinary powers, and this is true in the obvious sense that all the wonders of nature are no other than oneself. Beyond this, the gifts of psionic powers (siddhi) may or may not be manifested, just as there may or may not be good weather. In any milieu where the liberated guru is highly revered, people will faith-heal themselves of sickness in his presence, and attribute the cure to his magic. But meditation may be regarded as a state in which the fruits of nature and the potentialities of the human organism may develop more richly, though this will never happen if their growth is forced. So long, then, as we are concerned with powers, we are still aiming at increased control of nature and aggravating our frustrations. I am speaking, needless to say, of a control of nature supposedly imposed from the outside. It is really incorrect to think of nature as controlled, self-controlled, or uncontrolled, for the idea of control always involves a duality in which one element commands and the other obeys, or refuses to obey. The pattern or order of nature depends on no such division, since cause and effect, action and reaction, are simply two aspects or poles of a single process, or two ways of looking at it. No cause is separate from its effect, except for purposes of description in dualistic language.

As a rule, the mystics and gurus who are no longer seeking any attainment go on with what appears to be the formal practices of meditation. The various Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are usually depicted in the position of meditating in the padmasana or lotus-posture like any novice, but this is actually a ritual which is done for its own sake—as one might play the flute, or dance, or invite friends to a formal dinner. It is almost ridiculous to ask, "Why meditate?" as if it were going out of one’s way to do something bizarre, like lying on a bed of nails. Why look at the stars or watch clouds? Why go sailing to no fixed destination? Nothing is really explained by its cause or motivation, for we find only causes behind causes until we can pursue them no longer. It is like a child asking "Why? Why? Why?... " until its father, like a Zen master, says, "O shut up and suck your lollipop!"

Thus contemplation as a particular "exercise," done in a formal way, is simply the ritual enjoyment of that basic awareness of what is happening now which goes on always from moment to moment. In the same way, dancing as dancing is the ritual form of dancing while cooking, or dancing with the pen while writing. It is therefore quite against the spirit of such contemplation to undertake it in a mood of grim seriousness as is sometimes the way in monasteries and religious communities which are really schools for adolescents without true vocation to the contemplative life, where young people are drilled in ritual like conscripted soldiers. Children must under no circumstances 

# 11

be forced to participate in such exercises, just as we would not dream of requiring them to engage in sexual intercourse. In such ritual it is equally absurd to treat ourselves as children, and to browbeat ourselves into arduous practice with the thought that it will be good for us. The goal of contemplation is contemplation—not some future result that it may bring.

While there are traditional forms of the contemplative ritual, there are no fixed ways in which it must be done. It has, however, been found appropriate to sit like a Buddha with the legs crossed, or in lotus-posture, with the back easily erect and the breath coming and going on its own as if it were falling out and falling in, not as being pushed out or pulled in.

In the same spirit, one does not listen but simply hears all sounds that are emerging from silence without making any effort to place or identify them. Similarly, one does not look, but only sees light, color, and form playing with the eyes as they, too, emerge moment by moment from the void. Thoughts, likewise, are treated in the same way as sounds, and, if they arise, are merely watched without comment as they come and go, "hearing" them in the same way as one would hear the chattering of birds on the roof.

When the breath subsides into a slow rhythm, it is a special delight to let the voice float a tone upon it, with the sound OM, or the mantra OM AH HUM, and to hear the tone reverberating—perhaps to the accompaniment of a gong which is allowed to hum until its sound fades into all other

# 12

sounds. There are many suitable forms of such chanting ritual, employing not only prolonged single tones, but also rhythmic phrases repeated again and again, as for instance the familiar lilting mantra HARI KRISHNA, HARI KRISHNA, KRISHNA KRISHNA, HARI HARI; HARI RAMA, HARI RAMA, RAMA RAMA, HARI HARI. What is important here is not the meaning of the words but their actual sound and the movement of the breath and lips, giving direct experience of the basic energy of life as it comes from the void.

It is possible that in the course of contemplation there may arise visions or ecstatic states of consciousness, and it is a natural temptation to think of these as the goals of contemplation. However, to attempt to prolong these states, or to regain them when they subside, is like straining the facial muscles to see clearly, and is an effort to interrupt the natural flow of what is happening now. There may also arise a curious sensitivity to the unspoken thoughts and intentions of others, or astonishing dexterity of intellect or fidelity of memory, but these are not to be taken as signs of "progress" in contemplation, because contemplation ceases as soon as there is any seeking for results. Such temptations as these beset ritual contemplation in the same way as playing a musical instrument may be used for ends extraneous to the enjoyment of music, as in competing with oneself or with others for musical status.

Too much concern for ritual contemplation may also lead to a one-sidedly passive form of life and to the impression of

I woke a little while ago from a vivid dream about a child - a daughter of mine when she was young.

I got up, peed, and quietly (there were maybe eight other guys sleeping) in bunk beds, got clothes, my wallet, vest, and walked out to my car.

Blue channel now, that time when the sky is starting to get light where the sun will soon rise, but much of the sky is still dark. The sky shows a gradient of every color blue, deep dark blue to a pale sky blue. And every minute it changes greatly until it is down.

This is that auspicious time & magic time. A spiritual time, and here where I am in my car waiting, this is a spiritual place. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in Wappinger's Falls, NY. Something of a spiritual home for me. Not the only one, but a significant one. But isn't a Religion, what is religion, and what doesn't have to do with spirituality & what does it have to do with my spirit? Now is the question I think of as well explore, as the light of the day invades the dark of night.

When I think of "Religion," I think of something like Judaism, a faith I was brought up in. I was brought up to identify with it. Somehow my name, my face, my hair, all said "Jew" from the day I was born on the ward on my birth certificate said it, peeing between my legs said it. By the time I was a week old, I was cut to conform to being a Jew.

But though my parents were not religious at all, they got a discount on nursery school if they joined the temple - it was based on, so they did. I learned Jewish stories, Jewish traditions, Jewish words, I learned Hebrew... well not really, I learned the alphabet and how to pronounce the words and by the time I was 13 I could read enough to be Bar Mitzvahed. Insert big party.

I wasn't done with Judaism either, but I wasn't convinced either. Religions seemed to claim they had the answers, wrapped in stories about how the world came to be the way it is now. So I kept going to religious school, in the Reform temple I'd been raised in. I was interested in the questions the books said it answered so I did my due diligence. But I didn't get it.

Alongside my Jewish upbringing, I was also going to public school and learning about science. Judaism had this character they kept talking about - God. The books said some interesting things, but they all ended with "something God said," and that was the end of it, where else to go? Just say the prayers and you could get the bread. Whatever.

Science had a different approach. If I observed things, I tried things out, took notes and could be used to do things, to build better tools, to make more precise measurements, etc. Before long, I favored science over religion. I wrote an essay in High School on why I didn't believe in God.

Then I went to college. I learned science as a scientist might, at least at the beginning stages. Math, Chemistry, Physics, separate fields but there was a clear progression of order in everything I saw, everything I touched. I learned of people, polished.

One night walking around my neighborhood home for thanksgiving and wandering in a light snow feeling like I was in the bottom of a beaker with a crystal precipitating out of solution. I fell to my knees in wonder and awe. I was looking into the street light where I felt rather than understood the order to all things in the universe. Each bit of energy, the annihilation of a B, of me, that I was a part of a wave pushing out of the earth through me. I was a huge molecule, a standing wave of energetic cycles.

absurd attempt to transform the transformer, arising from the illusory distinction of thinker and thought, experiencer and experience.

So long as this subtle confusion remains, one can be beguiled into various ways of trying to meditate, and a competent guru will suggest techniques so clever that their absurdity will be difficult to discover without resolute attempts to follow them through. Furthermore, the aspirations and minor successes of other seekers will compound a collective illusion, and even a mutual one-upmanship contest, of believing that this or that method or guru is, at last, the one that really works. Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind. As the Zen patriarch Seng-ts'an put it:

The wise person does not strive;  
The ignorant man ties himself up...  
If you work on your mind with your mind,  
How can you avoid an immense confusion?

But once it has been explained, you may naturally ask whether it is really necessary to go through all this rigorous folly to dissipate the illusion. You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through. Yet shouldn’t it be clear that the very question "Is it necessary in order to dissipate?" arises directly from the illusion itself? If it isn’t clear, you will have the itch to go through the discipline, and try to "get some attainment and rise to some higher rank of spiritual superiority." But if it is clear,

Furthermore, the aspirations and minor successes of other seekers will compound a collective illusion, and even a mutual one-upmanship contest, of believing that this or that method or guru is, at last, the one that really works. Yet the intention of the guru himself is simply to exhaust the energy of the illusion by bringing his disciples again and again to experiences of the absurdity of trying to transform mind with mind.

The wise person does not strive;  
The ignorant man ties himself up...  
If you work on your mind with your mind,  
How can you avoid an immense confusion?

You will wonder whether knowing, theoretically, in advance that these disciplines are absurd, you will no longer have the motivation to follow them through.

July 5th and Hilary leaves for Norway.

In my email today, there was an email from a Turkish entrepreneur who wants to buy humanizer.com. Not that I want to sell it... but if I could get $100,000 it may be worth it! Of course, $200,000 would be even better. I'd still be sad to lose ed@humanizer.com as my main email address but yes, I could use the money. Perhaps I should buy a company that just has to have that name? Well... I'll figure out how to change my main email addresses, if I have to.

It's interesting that I finally wrote out the details on how to make humanizer.com into the "Visionary product management" solution.

He probably would like it for $100. Sorry, $1000 isn't enough. I'd like enough that I could pay off my car, fix all the body damage from different scrapes, maintain enough to still be able to get a new fast printer, cutouts to make notebooks, a new keyboard, computers, and an electric guitar. $5000 should do it.

I made it to Yoga on my own and did a nice but small kirtan at COSM. I'm thinking about the many things I'd like to do while Hilary is away - So many ideas, so little time.

I did hear back from the guy who asked to humanizer.com. He wants it for $250 even. Nopp, not enough. I talked with Tor about my idea facilitating large money-making projects, notable salespeople making commissions on selling notebooks. I think a lot can be done.

This morning I did get mail from Hilary. She arrived safe and is already having a wonderful time. Yay!

So I'm drinking coffee and I ate a muffin that Hilary had left me... It'd be great if I can get a talk fixed before I return at Omega thought... but that may not be possible because of my site. The NEW AGES site, their SSL expired yesterday and I don't want to use their junk for that site anyway.

Oh, so many things to do. But Confidence... the path of confidence is here. Yeah. Liz wants to come to visit. Coop is coming in on Monday tho. I need to call her...

I sat up a calibration event last night. It turned out to be a long night of contemplation, recording, listening to philosophy and science. I'm considering my step with Confidence, with a leadership role in the world of philosophy and the foundations of science and Religion... yes, it's time to start using that 'R' word.

I need a cohesive succinct & accurate account of why Derrida is not a "relativist" but rather Deconstruction is simply Phenomenology applied to text. Reading creates meaning but not in a way that the reader can choose a meaning, but rather meaning evolves a conjugate meaning. Some, the specific, therefore 'absolute' in each conscious meaning-space of the reader. This act of reading not only evokes a specific meaning but in doing so the meaning-space is acted upon by that act, thus changing the meaning-space such that the next time the same person reads that same text, it will evoke a new, evolved meaning.

Text cannot contain meaning, it can only point to it, or more properly, evoke it.

At COSM, The workshop has started, and most of the rooms are set up. It's my brother Joey's birthday, and Genevieve. Tomorrow is Eli's birthday. My birthday, Friday. It's a birthday week. Birthday season.

I do miss Hilary. It's not that I can't schedule myself but I see how much I lean on Hilary... on her sensibilities, her judgment. On her dependability. Aspire to be that dependable.

And I'm impatient about some things. And I want to pass through a portal into a new feeling I can't imagine from here.

Not much left in my mind. I don't have to write more, but I want to. What are the relevant words that I can put down which I will need from what do I have now in my mind that I'm afraid to lose? Is it fear?

I need to do more work to make money. That I don't I'll to get but I have to keep working on it.

Quite a nice COSM full moon last night - though a big one. There was a DJ and it went until 4 AM, which has been for solstice equinox parties. But still, a nice family event, meaning a good time for people to meet each other.

And now I have to make a decision. Dawn Cooke and I were talking, and she is the Volunteer coordinator for Gratitude Migration which is next weekend... and their lead for Sanctuary just dropped out. She'll comp me for the event... I'd love to do it... but I have to have someone to watch the cats. And I'm up for it? I was going to lead Sanctuary at Ignite but I've been involved with that community? Yet I do talk at Gratitude a few years ago and I do know many New York Burners. Oh, I wish Hilary were here to do it with me! She'd know what to do.

So anyway I'm sitting at registration checking people in to art church. It's a beautiful day.

"Head" & "Heart" are metaphors for Text Consciousness & Vortex Consciousness

Did I grow up today? It remains to be seen - but I did iron out a deal for money. *sigh*

I don't know what people think of me. I just notice more and more how little I get.

It is our world that dies. We're here together, for the long haul.

A Dream
2 May 2015
4:00 AM

The room was dark and most of the kids were sleeping or trying to go to sleep. But she wanted to talk to me when I poked my head in to check on them.

"I'm one of them... like the 'laygolers'"

"What?" I asked. I didn't understand the word she said.

"Laygolers" she repeated.

I still didn't get it.

"Like the Stephen King book. 'Laygolers'"

"Oh" Oh. I didn't read that book. I remember a TV movie adaptation - I only saw little parts.

"Someday, someone will write a book. Not about me but with someone with my name. Two "o"s." Coori said.

"Come, help me open the window."

We tried. It was clamped tight. We opened the latch, but were having trouble with the screen. She worked on one side & I worked on the other. We had a little slot you had to move against a spring. We pushed hard, but it didn't move the screen. We over forced, bent it, and the screen fell out, tipped and tumbled into the house next door. We could see in, adults as children, playing a game, laughing.

The children in our heads never grow up. We're always trying to help them as if we can. Mulling about nights they were scared, thinking about events we could have handled differently. She's a Capricorn and I don't even know what that means.

I woke a little while ago from a vivid dream about a child - a daughter of mine when she was young.

I got up, peed, and quietly (there were maybe eight others asleep), in bunk beds, got clothes, my wallet, vest, and walked out to my car.

Blue channel now, that time when the sky is starting to get light where the sun will soon rise, but much of the sky is still dark. The sky shows a gradient of every color blue, deep dark blue to a pale sky blue. And every minute it changes greatly until it is down.

This is that auspicious time & magic time. A spiritual time, and here where I am in my car waiting, this is a spiritual place. The Chapel of Sacred Mirrors in Wappinger's Falls, NY. Something of a spiritual home for me. Not the only one, but a significant one. But isn't a Religion, what is religion, and what doesn't have to be.

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.

THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

# 4

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

# 3

To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

# 2

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

The whole system is symbiotic in principle, for no individual can appear, for however short a time, except in mutual interdependence with the whole. For it could be said, in the rather clumsy language of nouns and verbs which arbitrarily distinguishes things from events, that the individual is something which the whole is doing, and that the whole is something which the individual is doing simultaneously. This relationship is not ordinarily felt or recognized in human consciousness, fascinated as it is by the apparent independence of the individual from the whole—and also frightened by it. The individual feels restricted to the area of his vibrating behavior, since all else seems to be an independent and uncontrollable happening on the part of something quite

other than himself. He does not realize that, just as one cannot walk without ground, one cannot experience being except in relation to happening, or self (center) except in relation to other (surround). Thus, nothing other than oneself is quite other, for between self and other, doing and happening, there is, again, the same kind of unity which exists between magnetic poles, or between the crest and the trough of a wave.

The system as a whole appears to be a distribution of solid entities or nodes of energy in the midst of emptiness or space. Human consciousness preoccupies itself with these entities, and virtually ignores their spatial background. We consider it "nothing," in the sense of that which has neither importance nor significance, forgetting that without the spatial field none of these entities could be manifested or distinguished. There is, however, between space and entity the same polar relationship as between crest and trough, for which reason nothingness is not simply the contrary or absence of being but rather its ground and origin. We believe so firmly in the maxim "ex nihilo nihil fit"—if nothing can come out of nothing—that it is almost impossible for us to see that emptiness is the essential prerequisite for every form of being, unless we can conceive that space has some structure concealed from our senses.

While there are indeed such structures or processes as cosmic rays which do not appear to the naked senses, the usefulness and potency of emptiness is, as Lao-tzu said, precisely, that it is perfectly empty. "Being and non-being arise mutually." Thus not to see the unity of self and other is the fear of life, and not to see the unity of being and non-being is the fear of death.

# 3

To understand the reciprocity or mutual interdependence of polar opposites—being and nothing, center and surround, self and other, doing and happening—might be called polar vision. I have been speaking of it in the dry terms of logic, in which it may be grasped intellectually. But when polar vision comes in the form of immediate sensation and feeling, it is known as mystical experience or cosmic consciousness, and of this it is better to speak in the mode of poetry and paradox. Thus to feel polar vision is to feel that what happens to you is your own doing, and that your own doing is happening to you; that death and emptiness is the firm ground upon which life walks; and that oneself as both center and surround is the eternal universe. But this feeling, or intuition, does not come in the form of words or ideas, and does not depend on any trick of imagination or self-suggestion. It is more as when one simply sees the sky or feels that one is alive.

This feeling, or, rather, the basis for it, is always present. We are unaware of it only because our consciousness is distracted by another and incompatible feeling of identity which almost all thinking peoples learn from childhood. All too easily, we confuse symbols and signs with what they represent, as in saying, "this is a tree," when that to which we are pointing is quite other than the sound "tree." At a much deeper level we confuse what we actually are, as center-and-surround or organism-and-environment, with an idea, concept, or image of ourselves from which the interdependence of self and other is absent. This image we call the "I," the ego, the person, or the subject (as distinct from the object). We consider it as the doer of our deeds, the thinker of our thoughts, and the feeler of our feelings.

# 4

It is a false image for three reasons. 

The first is that it is only a concept or symbol, and thus can no more do anything than the word "water" can quench thirst. The second is that it is no more than an impoverished caricature of our whole organism, since there is nothing in it which corresponds to the subconscious processes of our being. The third is that it entirely leaves out the polar unity of the organism with the universe, ignoring the fact that the two are a single process.

Under the impression that this pure abstraction is the vital core and organizing center of our being, we try to exert its "will" when action is difficult or emotions hard to restrain. Thus in "taking a hard look" at something, or listening intently, we tighten muscles in the regions of the eyes and ears. We scratch our heads when we are puzzled, and frown when we are trying to pay close attention. We grit our teeth when trying to endure pain, clench our fists when trying to "hold on to ourselves," and tighten our stomach muscles when attempting to restrain anxiety. All these actions are futile, and do nothing to attain the desired objectives. But they are chronic and habitual, and build up a generalized state of bodily tension, often centered just above and between the eyes, which serves as the referent, the felt experience, corresponding to the symbol-image of the person or ego—thus marrying an illusion to a futility.

The question—what, then, can be done to overcome this false sense of identity and to replace it with polar vision and cosmic consciousness—is impossible to answer in its own terms. All that needs to be experienced for cosmic consciousness is already

# THE ART OF CONTEMPLATION.

THE INDIVIDUAL is an aperture through which the whole energy of the universe is aware of itself, a vortex of vibrations in which it realizes itself as man or beast, flower or star—not alone, but as central to all that surrounds it. These centers are not, as may seem, apart from their surroundings, but stand in mutual relationship to them—center to circumference—in the same way as the magnetic poles. It is thus that each center anywhere implies all other centers elsewhere. The individual is not, therefore, only a center. He is the entire surround centered at this time or this place, which is why the astrologers try to infer the character of an individual from the disposition of the universe encircling him, though it is doubtful whether they know how to read it correctly.

And - Strangely enough - I felt like God. Not "God" like the character in a story written a long time ago who if you eat and get the crystal energetic bacon but it is the light and presence that is the light in my eye seeing that light.

I went home and I tried to write down what I had seen, what I had felt, and it was inadequate. In the next year and a half, I wrote down revelations, I scribbled diagrams, I was trying to somehow convey in words, in metrics, and diagrams what I had learned in an instant, looking at that street light. I showed my work to my friends, and they didn't get it, showed it to my professors, and they told me to do my homework. I was getting discouraged until the first day of my first class in Buddhism.

Something in that class told me I wasn't alone. What I saw wasn't unique to me. This guy, the Buddha, saw it too. He was just a regular guy who noticed an extraordinary thing that was there all along. That is hidden everything yet is not visible. Ironically paradoxically it is the essence of vision itself.

Religions are the organizations built around spiritual experiences that other people have had. They come with stories that give a vocabulary to these experiences and the institutions of religion offer these stories to people who then use the vocabularies to explain and to a certain extent, constrain their own encounters with their own inner spiritual life. Science is not very different except that it develops stories about how the senses work and supplies a vocabulary to explain the world as it arrives at your senses.

For me, Buddhism is both and yet neither a religion nor a science. It does supply a useful framework and vocabulary to organize spiritual experience, it also offers a framework and vocabulary for organizing rigorous observation of the sensual world. Yet, the highest value in Buddhism is on personal practice, personal experience. It is through meditation that one is advised to watch the subtle workings of one's own mind. Below the wordy narration of life when people think of as "me", there is an energetic presence - What is me except an energetic presence? That is a void. It is emptiness as a dynamic force, not in a sense of a concrete thing, but in turning back to see what & who has decayed.

What has not changed is the inadequacy of words describing my experience. At best, it is all a metaphor. At best, Religion & Science alike are metaphors for what you are experiencing now as you trust in these words. You may be reading truth from a text, religious, scientific, or otherwise - but it is the inherent spiritual essence which is creating that truth, now in your mind.

May these words be a catalyst for your own truth, support for your own insights which are too subtle, and too precise to be put into words.

Truth cannot be written. It can only be read for it is the mind of the reader, the mind of the one who observes, who creates it. The sun has risen. Another day begins. Anyone can describe the sun, but only your energetic presence can feel it on your skin. Spirituality is presence that religions can only write about.

falling away from the eternal now while engaged in other and more strenuous activities. Now the habitual use of muscular tension as the referent for the ego in looking, listening, and willing carries over into the use of natural physical exertion in running, lifting, and hauling so as to make such actions seem entirely different from those which happen "of themselves," spontaneously. Curiously, this sets up, say, in the effort to run, a redundant effort to make the effort, giving the impression that the exertion of running is a direct demonstration of the activity and potency of the ego-image. We have learned, mostly as children, to put on an act of strenuousness while doing strenuous things. Yet efforts to make efforts, being redundant, work against the natural use of muscular energy in such a way that they are self-imposed obstacles, or efforts against effort. It is as if, in pulling, the triceps were to work against the biceps. When this redundant use of effort falls away, it becomes obvious that decisions to do this or that, and the consequent physical actions, happen of themselves like everything else.

For free action is certainly not caused by a purely abstract "I." It emerges from the total intelligence of the organism, in the same way as the growth of the brain and the digestion of food, and it will employ conscious reasoning in situations where reasoning is an appropriate tool. This would perhaps be called biologically or physically "determined" action by those who separate the organism from the rest of the universe, and see it "obeying" or "responding" to "drives" which have first been defined as external to itself.

# 14

But the individual-and-universe has no external or extraneous determinant. The individual may be seen as constrained by natural processes only when viewed out of context as something in but not of its whole environment. Laws and artificial restraints become necessary when, through the illusion of separateness, the individual loses touch with his organic intelligence and feels at odds with his environment. Obviously, the operation of organic intelligence is not to be confused with the false spontaneity of actions deliberately calculated to be at variance with natural order or human law. Social conventions still govern those who go out of their way to oppose them.

In past times all matters concerning the practice of contemplation were considered esoteric or, what amounts in the West to the same thing, heretical—though not every heresy was of this order, and the contemplative way became heresy only as people tried to describe its content. For, speaking in religious language, it would be plain to the contemplative that only God exists, and that there is nothing other than God. For obvious reasons this is a doctrine greatly feared by both ecclesiastical and secular rulers. On the one hand, when it is necessary that the people be exploited and oppressed, it is important to imbue them with a servile mentality. On the other hand, when people are vulgar and greedy, the mere idea that "all is God" or that good and evil are polar is used to justify every wanton excess. It is for this reason that governments forbid the ingestion of hemp flowers and other psychedelic substances, lest immature and half-civilized individuals profane the mysteries. One does not wish noble wines to be used for drunken brawls.

The fiction of the isolated ego or person as the real individual has therefore been implanted to stimulate the feeling of creatureliness and the fear of God. It is likewise advantageous to rulers that the people be blind to the polarity of life and death, and so fear death if they fear not God. But when those who implant this fiction are also its dupes, they seek for themselves as persons the powers which they already enjoy as God, but have forgotten. In this endeavor they resort to such crude wisdom as may be expressed in linear signs, words, and numbers for the government of a non-linear and immeasurably subtle world. And as the person is a linear version of man, confused with the real man, so the linear understanding of the world—with which linear wisdom must deal—is confused with the real world. Only by violence, then, can the real and living world be straightened out, squared away, evened off, boxed into clear-cut categories, and so conformed to the crudities of linear wisdom. Consequently, all the balances and interdependencies of nature are thrown into confusion—to the bewilderment of birds, beasts, and plants, and the befuddlement of man's own non-linear body and brain. In such an emergency it is necessary to take the risks of exposing the illusion of the person and all its works, and to allow what has been esoteric to become generally known.

It is thus that, in contemplation, man discovers himself as inseparable from the cosmos as a whole in both its positive and negative aspects, its appearances and disappearances. Astronomy and physics are therefore theoretical adumbrations of the vastness of our dimensions,

# 15

for it is not simply that we are subordinate parts of the system, but that the entire system is oneself in its full and only true sense. Ordinarily, we may glimpse this truth in a shallowly intellectual way, and consider it as a lofty idea that has little relation to practical affairs and basic emotions. But in contemplation this view is as real and self-evident as breathing, and enables the problems of mundane life to be seen in their true perspective—sub specie aeternitatis—balancing and correcting the usual myopia of exclusive preoccupation with nasty little games and schemes.

Nature, that is, our own true nature, is bringing these preoccupations to a stop by coming forth with the technical power to pursue them on a colossal scale, hitherto unknown. Pursued and magnified with such power, they come swiftly to absurdity and catastrophe—so that their innate contradictions become obvious to all. For we have been trying to harness technology to the impossible game of having positive without negative, defying the principles of that very electricity upon which technology so largely depends. This objective is as illusory as the ego which seeks it.

Thus a time when the objective seems clearly unattainable is a time ripe for the unmasking of that ego—itself the persona-mask which conceals the splendor of our Original Face. When spring comes the buds break out of their husks, the little birds cast off their shells, and young plants burst from their seed-casings.... When there is a crack in the Cosmic Egg, Buddha is about to be born.

### Insight from Se Anna's Holistic Journey
*Quality: 0.30 | Words: 136 | Date: 2024-03-11*

Introducing Se Se Anna;
A visionary seeker on a path of profound personal evolution.
