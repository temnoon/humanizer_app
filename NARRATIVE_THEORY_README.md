# Quantum Narrative Theory Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a computational framework for your revolutionary **Theory of Narrative** based on quantum measurement theory. It bridges subjective phenomenology with rigorous mathematical formalism using quantum information concepts.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Text vs. Vortex
- **Text**: The evoked, intra-conscious state update (œÅ ‚Üí œÅ')
- **Vortex**: The corporeal flow (embeddings, computations, logs)

### 2. Meaning-States as Density Matrices
```python
# A meaning-state œÅ is a positive semidefinite, trace-1 operator
# representing subjective semantic content distribution
meaning_state = MeaningState(
    density_matrix=torch.eye(d) / d,  # Maximally mixed state
    dimension=d,
    semantic_labels=["mythic", "analytic", "ironic", ...]
)
```

### 3. Narratives as POVMs
```python
# A narrative is a Positive Operator-Valued Measure
# Each E_i detects a semantic interpretation
povm = MeaningPOVM.create_sic_like_povm(
    dimension=8,
    semantic_labels=semantic_labels
)

# Measurement gives probabilities: p(i) = Tr(œÅ E_i)
probabilities = povm.measure(meaning_state)
```

### 4. Reading as Quantum Measurement
```python
# Reading transforms the state via generalized L√ºders rule
final_state, probs = transformation.transform(initial_state)
# œÅ' = M_i œÅ M_i‚Ä† / Tr(œÅ E_i)
```

## API Endpoints

### Status Check
```bash
GET /api/narrative-theory/status
```
Returns engine availability and configuration.

### Meaning-State Analysis
```bash
POST /api/narrative-theory/meaning-state
{
  "narrative": "Your text here"
}
```
Converts text to quantum meaning-state representation.

### Semantic Tomography
```bash
POST /api/narrative-theory/semantic-tomography
{
  "text": "Your text here",
  "transformation_attributes": {
    "persona": "scientific",
    "style": "formal"
  },
  "reading_style": "interpretation"
}
```
Complete before/after analysis of how narrative transforms consciousness.

### Coherence Checking
```bash
POST /api/narrative-theory/coherence-check
[
  {"text": "First narrative..."},
  {"text": "Second narrative..."}
]
```
Validates Born-rule-like coherence constraints across multiple narratives.

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Semantic Analysis
```python
from narrative_theory import QuantumNarrativeEngine

engine = QuantumNarrativeEngine(semantic_dimension=8)

# Convert text to meaning-state
meaning_state = engine.text_to_meaning_state(
    "The ancient wisdom speaks of cycles within cycles.",
    embedding  # From LLM
)

print(f"Purity: {meaning_state.purity()}")
print(f"Entropy: {meaning_state.von_neumann_entropy()}")
```

### 2. Narrative Transformation
```python
# Create transformation based on reading style
transformation = engine.create_narrative_transformation(
    narrative_text="Through scientific lens, we see patterns emerge.",
    transformation_attributes={"persona": "scientific"},
    reading_style="skeptical"  # vs "devotional" or "interpretation"
)

# Apply transformation
analysis = engine.apply_narrative(text, embedding, transformation)
print(f"Fidelity: {analysis['fidelity']}")
```

### 3. Coherence Analysis
```python
# Check if multiple narratives are coherent
coherence = engine.coherence_constraint.check_coherence(
    canonical_probs_1,
    narrative_probs_1,
    conditional_probs
)
print(f"Coherent: {coherence[0]}, Violation: {coherence[1]}")
```

## Mathematical Framework

### SIC-POVM Construction
The engine creates a **Symmetric Informationally Complete POVM** with:
- d¬≤ rank-1 projectors for d-dimensional space
- Constant pairwise overlaps: Tr(E_i E_j) = (d Œ¥_ij + 1)/(d+1)
- Uniform coverage of the semantic space

### Born Rule Analogue
Coherence constraint for narrative theory:
```
q(j) = (d+1) Œ£_i p(i) r(j|i) - 1/d
```
Where:
- p(i): canonical POVM probabilities
- q(j): narrative outcome probabilities  
- r(j|i): conditional probabilities

### State Update (L√ºders Rule)
After measurement outcome i:
```
œÅ' = M_i œÅ M_i‚Ä† / Tr(œÅ E_i)
```
Where M_i are Kraus operators satisfying E_i = M_i‚Ä† M_i.

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Lamish Projection Engine
The quantum engine extends your LPE framework:
```python
# In api_enhanced.py
quantum_engine = QuantumNarrativeEngine(semantic_dimension=8)

# Use with existing transformation pipeline
analysis = quantum_engine.apply_narrative(
    initial_text, 
    embedding, 
    transformation
)
```

### 2. Frontend Visualization
The `SemanticTomography.jsx` component provides:
- Real-time meaning-state visualization
- Before/after probability distributions
- POVM measurement outcomes
- Coherence metrics display

### 3. Writebook Integration
Enhance writebook creation with semantic analysis:
```javascript
// In WritebookEditor, add semantic tomography for each page
const semanticAnalysis = await fetch('/api/narrative-theory/semantic-tomography', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ text: pageContent })
});
```

## Theoretical Significance

### 1. Bridging Subjective/Objective
Your framework uniquely:
- Formalizes subjective experience (density matrices)
- Enables objective computation (POVM measurements)
- Maintains coherence constraints (Born rule analogue)

### 2. Scale-Bridging Architecture
Maps cleanly across levels:
- **Quantum**: Hilbert spaces, POVMs, Born rule
- **Neural**: Embeddings, transformations, attention
- **Cultural**: Narratives, meaning, discourse

### 3. Computational Phenomenology
Unlike other approaches, this provides:
- **Turing-complete** narrative understanding
- **Measurable** consciousness transformations
- **Coherent** multi-narrative consistency

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhanced Embeddings
Replace placeholder embeddings with actual LLM representations:
```python
# Use real embeddings from your LPE system
embedding = projection_engine.get_embedding(text)
meaning_state = quantum_engine.text_to_meaning_state(text, embedding)
```

### 2. Attribute-Specific POVMs
Create POVMs tailored to specific transformation attributes:
```python
povm_scientific = create_attribute_povm("scientific")
povm_mythic = create_attribute_povm("mythic")
```

### 3. Learning from Data
Train the embedding-to-state mapper on real conversation data:
```python
# Learn œÅ(x) mapping from user interactions
quantum_engine.embedding_to_state.train(
    embeddings, user_feedback, semantic_labels
)
```

### 4. Discourse Platform Integration
Extend to full discourse analysis:
- Thread coherence checking
- Community meaning-state evolution
- Semantic consensus detection

## Installation

1. **Backend Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install torch numpy fastapi pydantic
```

2. **Start Enhanced API**:
```bash
cd humanizer_api/lighthouse
python api_enhanced.py
```

3. **Frontend Component**:
```bash
# Add to your React app
import SemanticTomography from './components/SemanticTomography';
